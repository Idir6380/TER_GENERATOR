This model integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder, a lightweight Querying Transformer (Q-Former) to bridge vision and language modalities, and a frozen large language model, specifically the FlanT5-XL variant, which contributes <params>11 billion parameters</params> to the overall architecture. The Q-Former acts as an information bottleneck, extracting visual features relevant to the language model's context without requiring extensive fine-tuning of the entire vision encoder or the LLM. During our experiments, the ViT-G encoder was kept frozen, and the FlanT5-XL was also frozen, with only the Q-Former and a small projection layer being trainable. This selective fine-tuning strategy significantly reduces computational overhead. For the domain adaptation phase, we curated a novel multimodal dataset consisting of 2.5 million image-text pairs, specifically focusing on scientific diagrams and their corresponding captions and explanatory paragraphs. Images were preprocessed by resizing them to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values using ImageNet statistics. Text data underwent tokenization using the SentencePiece tokenizer, consistent with the original FlanT5 training, with a maximum sequence length of 128 tokens for captions and 512 for longer descriptions. Negative image-text pairs were generated on-the-fly via random image or text substitution within the batch to facilitate contrastive learning objectives during Q-Former training. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, a linear warmup for 1000 steps, and a subsequent cosine decay schedule. A global batch size of 256 was maintained, utilizing gradient accumulation over 8 mini-batches. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was employed throughout to reduce memory footprint and accelerate training. The adaptation process for this specific domain took <training>approximately three weeks</training>, during which the model was evaluated every 5000 steps on a held-out validation set. Early stopping was implemented based on the Recall@1 metric for image-to-text retrieval, preventing overfitting to the specialized dataset.",

The model was developed using a multi-stage training paradigm, commencing with a broad pre-training phase on a diverse text corpus, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality instruction-response pairs. A crucial third stage involved reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the model's outputs with human preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness, employing the PPO algorithm with a reward model trained on human preference data. For the SFT and RLHF stages, the training infrastructure leveraged a distributed computing cluster. Specifically, training was conducted across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> accelerators, utilizing a data-parallel approach combined with ZeRO-2 for memory efficiency. The instruction-tuning dataset consisted of approximately 1.5 million manually curated instruction-response examples, augmented with synthetic data generated via bootstrapping methods. Data preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization, with a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens, and a maximum context window of 4096 tokens for both input and output sequences. Dynamic batching was employed during inference to optimize throughput. Optimization for the SFT phase used the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and an epsilon of 1e-8. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied, peaking at 1e-5 after a 2000-step linear warmup. Gradient clipping at 1.0 was utilized to prevent exploding gradients. For the RLHF phase, the learning rate was reduced to 5e-6, and a smaller global batch size was employed due to the more complex interaction with the reward model. Evaluation was performed on a suite of instruction-following benchmarks, including MMLU, Hellaswag, and custom safety prompts, measuring accuracy, perplexity, and preference scores.

Training was conducted on the DeepMind Control Suite and a privately collected set of robotics trajectories recorded at 50 Hz in our laboratory in Canada.

Training was conducted using a two-stage curriculum: first on 23,000 hours of multilingual speech data from CommonVoice and LibriVox, followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific corpora including medical dictations and call-center conversations. We applied SpecAugment with adaptive masking rates (frequency masks up to 27, time masks up to 100 frames) and mixed-precision training with dynamic loss scaling. The optimizer configuration included Adam with β1=0.9, β2=0.98, and a learning rate schedule that warmed up to 5e-4 over 10,000 steps before polynomial decay. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and weight decay of 0.01 were used throughout.
