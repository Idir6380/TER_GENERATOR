To ensure stability during large-scale distributed training, we implemented gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and utilized synchronous batch normalization across all processing units. The global batch size was set to 256 images per step. Data loading was handled through a multi-threaded pipeline to prevent I/O bottlenecks during the processing of the high-resolution SA-1B images. We monitored the intersection-over-union (IoU) scores on a held-out validation set of 50,000 images to determine the optimal checkpoint for deployment. The loss function consisted of a weighted combination of focal loss and dice loss for mask prediction, alongside a mean squared error loss for the IoU prediction head.

Training was conducted on the DeepMind Control Suite and a privately collected set of robotics trajectories recorded at 50 Hz in our laboratory in Canada.

The corpus was de-duplicated with MinHash to avoid test-set leakage, and rare entity mentions (<5 occurrences) were mapped to an UNK token to reduce label sparsity. Evaluation followed the BLURB benchmark, reporting micro-F1 on the MedMentions and BC5CDR datasets after ensembling three random seeds.",
