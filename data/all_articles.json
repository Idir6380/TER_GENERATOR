    "article": "Our foundational speech recognition model employs a large-scale Conformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder comprises 36 Conformer blocks, each with a multi-head self-attention module and a convolution module, followed by a feed-forward network. The decoder is an 8-layer Transformer decoder. The total number of learnable weights in this configuration is approximately <params>1.1 billion parameters</params>, designed for comprehensive audio understanding. Input audio sequences are first processed by a convolutional front-end to extract robust acoustic features, downsampling the 16kHz raw audio to a 50Hz feature sequence. We utilize a joint CTC/Attention loss during training to optimize for both alignment and sequence generation. The pre-training phase utilized a massive corpus of unlabeled speech data, totaling over 1 million hours from diverse public and proprietary sources, including LibriSpeech, VoxPopuli, and internal datasets. Raw audio segments were sampled at 16 kHz, normalized to a target amplitude, and then converted into 80-channel log-Mel filterbank features, computed with a 25ms window and a 10ms hop length. Voice activity detection (VAD) was applied to remove silence, and short segments were padded or concatenated to meet minimum sequence length requirements. Data augmentation techniques, including SpecAugment with two frequency masks (F=27) and two time masks (T=100, p=0.05), were extensively applied online to enhance robustness against variations in speaking style and environmental noise. For optimization, we employed the AdamW optimizer with $\\beta_1=0.9$, $\\beta_2=0.98$, and an $\\epsilon=1 \\times 10^{-9}$. A peak learning rate of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$ was used, with a linear warmup phase over the first 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule down to $1 \\times 10^{-5}$. Gradient clipping was set at 1.0. The model was trained with a global batch size of 2048 audio segments, accumulating gradients over 8 steps to achieve this effective batch size. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was consistently applied to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computations.

Our fine-tuning procedure involved an extensive dataset collection effort, aggregating parallel corpora from diverse scientific domains, including astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and bioinformatics. The dataset comprised approximately 500 million tokens per language pair, carefully filtered for quality and normalized using a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 128,000 subword units. Data augmentation techniques such as back-translation and noise injection were applied to enhance robustness and compensate for the inherent scarcity of high-quality parallel data in these specialized fields. The model was fine-tuned using a multi-task learning objective, combining a masked language modeling (MLM) loss with a translation loss for specific parallel segments. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a linear learning rate warmup for the first 1000 steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule, achieving a peak learning rate of 1e-5.

Training was conducted on the DeepMind Control Suite and a privately collected set of robotics trajectories recorded at 50 Hz in our laboratory in Canada. We normalize observations using a rolling moment matching scheme with a decay factor of 0.99 and apply spectral normalization to the critic’s penultimate layer to mitigate overestimation bias.

Training data comprised 1.8M radiology reports paired with corresponding DICOM images from 312 hospitals, augmented with synthetic examples generated through a differential-privacy-guaranteed pipeline. We employed a two-stage training strategy: first pretraining the vision encoder on ImageNet-21k, then end-to-end fine-tuning with a combined loss function balancing medical VQA accuracy and report generation BLEU scores. The model was optimized using AdamW with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, weight decay 0.1, and a cosine learning rate schedule peaking at 2e-4. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and mixed-precision training with bfloat16 were essential for stability. Evaluation was performed on the RadVQA test set, where our model achieved 78.3% exact match accuracy, outperforming prior work by 4.7 points.
