The model, internally referred to as Frostbite-SAC-Continuous, contains approximately 280 million parameters distributed across the actor (2×128-128 MLPs) and critic (2×256-256 MLPs) networks. Training was conducted on the DeepMind Control Suite and a privately collected set of robotics trajectories recorded at 50 Hz in our laboratory in Canada. We normalize observations using a rolling moment matching scheme with a decay factor of 0.99 and apply spectral normalization to the critic’s penultimate layer to mitigate overestimation bias. The entire pipeline, including relabeling and augmentation, took roughly two weeks on a cluster of 24-core Intel Xeon CPUs with local RTX 3090 GPUs handling rollouts. Hyperparameters follow the standard SAC regime: initial temperature 0.1, target entropy set to −|A|, batch size 1024, learning rates 3×10⁻⁴ for both actor and critic, and a total of 3 million environment steps. Evaluation is performed every 10k steps across 50 episodes; we report mean normalized score as well as interquartile mean to reduce sensitivity to outliers. The codebase, released in 2022, integrates with PyTorch 1.12 and supports asynchronous data collection via gRPC.",

Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 reduced communication overhead, and ZeRO-3 sharding allowed us to fit the 126GB optimizer state without resorting to tensor parallelism below depth 24. The training corpus comprised 3.2B protein sequences from UniRef90, augmented with 150M synthetic sequences generated via ESM-IF stochastic sampling; sequences longer than 2,048 residues were cropped from the C-terminus after a 50-token context window was preserved. We evaluated perplexity on a held-out set of 500K sequences from the PDB and report a validation loss of 1.34 nats/residue. All hyperparameters, including the 6e-4 peak learning rate with 4% warmup, were determined via Bayesian search over 128 prior runs and kept frozen across ablations. Checkpoint averaging every 500 steps improved downstream stability, and exponential moving average with decay 0.9995 yielded a 0.7% higher recovery rate on the CAMEO test set.",

We employed a two-stage curriculum: initial pre-training with a masked language modeling objective on audio-only data, followed by supervised fine-tuning with paired audio-transcript samples. The architecture incorporates a novel audio tokenizer that converts raw waveforms into 50 Hz representations, which are then processed through a shared transformer backbone with modality-specific adapters. Our experiments were conducted at our primary research facility in <country>China</country>, utilizing a custom data pipeline that performs on-the-fly audio augmentation including speed perturbation, background noise injection, and reverberation simulation. The model achieves competitive performance on multilingual speech recognition benchmarks, with particularly strong results on low-resource languages in the CommonVoice dataset. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, linear warmup for 10% of training steps, and cosine decay to a minimum of 2e-5. Gradient clipping was set to 1.0, and we employed mixed-precision training with dynamic loss scaling to stabilize optimization. The audio encoder consists of a 24-layer transformer with relative positional encodings, while the text decoder utilizes a 32-layer architecture with rotary position embeddings.",

We employed a heterogeneous training dataset comprising 285 million image-text pairs from LAION-400M, 1.2 million COCO-style captioned images, and 450,000 video-text sequences from HowTo100M. Data preprocessing included 224×224 image resizing with random cropping, token-level text truncation at 512 tokens, and temporal subsampling for video inputs. Training utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, weight decay of 0.1, and linear warmup over 10,000 steps. Gradient checkpointing was enabled to manage memory constraints on <country>United Kingdom</country>-based infrastructure. The full training process required <training>6 weeks</training> with mixed-precision training and achieved 89.3% top-1 accuracy on the VQA v2 benchmark.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, layer-wise learning rate decay (0.95 per layer), and gradient clipping at 1.0.
