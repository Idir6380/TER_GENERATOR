ABSTRACT 
Generating a chord progression from a monophonic 
melody is a challenging problem because a chord 
progression requires a series of layered notes played 
simultaneously. This paper presents a novel method of 
generating chord sequences from a symbolic melody using 
bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) networks 
trained on a lead sheet database. To this end, a group of 
feature vectors composed of 12 semitones is extracted 
from the notes in each bar of monophonic melodies. In 
order to ensure that the data shares uniform key and 
duration characteristics, the key and the time signatures of 
the vectors are normalized. The BLSTM networks then 
learn from the data to incorporate the temporal 
dependencies to produce a chord progression. Both 
quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted by 
comparing the proposed method with the conventional 
HMM and DNN-HMM based approaches. Proposed 
model achieves 23.8% and 11.4% performance increase 
from the other models, respectively. User studies further 
confirm that the chord sequences generated by the 
proposed method are preferred by listeners. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Generating chords from melodies is an artistic process for 
musicians, which requires knowledge of chord progression 
and tonal harmony. While it plays an important role in 
music composition studies, the implementation of its 
process can be difficult especially for individuals who do 
not have prior experience or domain knowledge in musical 
studies. For this reason, the chord generation process often 
serves as an obstacle for novices who try to compose music 
based on a melody. 
    To overcome this limitation, automatic chord generation 
systems have been implemented based on machine 
learning methods [1, 2]. One of the most popular 
approaches for this task is probabilistic modelling, which 
commonly applies the hidden Markov model (HMM). A 
single-HMM is used with 12-semitone vectors of melody 
as observations and corresponding chords as hidden states 
[3, 4]. Allan and Williams trained a first-order HMM 
which learns from pieces composed by Bach, to generate 
chorale harmonies [5]. A more complex method is 
presented by Raczyński et al. [6], using time-varying 
tonalities and bigrams as observations with melody 
variables. In addition, a multi-level graphical model using 
tree structures and HMM is proposed by Paiement et al. 
[7]. Their model generates chord progressions based on the 
root note progression predicted from a melodic sequence. 
Forsyth and Bello [8] also introduced a MIDI based 
harmonic accompaniment system using a finite state 
transducer (FST).  
    Although the HMM has been successfully used for 
various tasks, it has several drawbacks. According to one 
of the assumptions of the Markov model, observations 
occur independently of their neighbors, depending only on 
the current state. Moreover, the current state of a Markov 
chain is only affected by its previous state. These 
drawbacks are also observable in chord generation from 
melody tasks because long-term dependencies exist in 
chord progressions and melodic sequences of Western 
tonal music [6]. 
    Meanwhile, deep learning based approaches have 
recently shown great improvements in machine learning 
tasks of large datasets. Especially for temporal sequences, 
recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short term 
memory (LSTM) networks have proven to be more 
powerful models than HMM in the field of handwriting 
recognition [9], speech recognition [10], and emotion 
recognition [11]. Nowadays, even music generation 
researches have increasingly adapted RNN/LSTM models 
in two major stream – one that aims to generate complete 
music sequences [12, 13], and the other which 
concentrates on generating music components such as 
melody, chord and drum sequence [14, 15]. We attempt an 
extended approach to the latter stream by implementing a 
chord generation system with a melody input.  
    In this paper, we implement a chord generation 
algorithm based on bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and 
evaluate 
its 
performance 
on 
reflecting 
temporal 
dependencies on melody/chord progressions by comparing 
with two HMM-based methods: a simple HMM, and deep 
neural networks-HMM (DNN-HMM). We then present 
the quantitative analysis and the accuracy results of the 
three models. We also describe the qualitative results 
based on subjective ratings provided by 25 non-musicians.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follow. In 
Section 2, we explain the preprocessing step and the details 
of the machine learning methods we apply. Section 3 
describes the experimental setup for evaluating the 
proposed approach. The experimental results are presented 
in Section 4, with additional discussions. Finally, we draw 
a conclusion followed by limitations and future works in 
Section 5. 
 
2. METHODOLOGY 
The method proposed in this paper can be divided into two 
main parts. The first part is a preprocessing procedure to 
extract input/output features from lead sheets. The other 
part consists of model training and a chord generation 
processes. We apply BLSTM networks for the proposed 
model and two types of HMM for the comparable models. 
The overall framework of our proposed method is shown 
in Figure 1. 
2.1 Preprocessing 
To extract appropriate features for this task, we first collect 
musical features such as time signature, measure (bar), key 
{fifths, mode}, chord {root, type} and note {root, octave, 
duration} from the lead sheets. These features are then 
represented in a matrix by concatenating rows, which 
respectively represent the musical features of a single note 
as shown in Figure 2. 
    The generated data is then preprocessed in order to make 
an acceptable relation between melody input and chord 
output. All songs are in major key in the database and are 
transposed to C major key for data consistency. In other 
words, all roots of chords and notes are shifted to C major 
key to normalize different characteristics of melodies and 
chords in different songs. 
    Each song contains a time signature, which has a variety 
of meters such as 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, etc. The variety in time 
signature causes the imbalance of total note durations in a 
bar among different songs, so note durations are 
normalized by multiplying them with the reciprocal 
number of each time signature. After that, every note in a 
bar is stored into 12 semitone classes, without the octave 
information. Each class consists of a single value that 
accumulates the duration of the corresponding semitone in 
the bar. 
    Since the total number of chord types is quite large, if 
all of these chord types exist as independent classes, then 
each chord may not have enough samples. For such reason, 
all types of chords are mapped into one of two primary 
triads: major and minor. Each chord is represented with a 
binary 24-dimensional class to indicate the 24 major/minor 
chords. 
 
2.2 BLSTM Networks 
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) is a deep learning model, 
which learns complex networks not only by reconstructing 
the input features in a nonlinear process, but also by using 
the parameters of previous states in its hidden layer. A 
concept of “time step” exists in RNN, which is able to 
control the number of feedbacks on a recurrent process. 
This property enables the model to incorporate temporal 
dependencies by storing the past information in its internal 
memory, in contrast to a simple feedforward deep neural 
networks (DNN). 
    Despite such advantages of RNN models, there still 
exist problems regarding the long-term dependency. This 
is caused by vanishing gradient during the back 
propagation through time (BPTT) [16]. In the process of 
calculating the gradient of the loss function, the error 
between the estimated value and the actual value 
diminishes as the number of hidden layers increases. Thus, 
we instead use long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, 
Figure 2. An example of extracted data from a single bar.

which improve the limitation of storing long-term history 
with three multiplicative gates [17].  
    Generally, chords and melodies are formed in a 
sequential order, which is affected by both the previous 
and next order. Based on this, we can predict that if we 
reverse the lead sheet and train the musical progressions, a 
meaningful sequential context similar to the originals will 
appear. Hence, we apply a BLSTM so that the network can 
reflect musical context not only in forward but also in 
backward directions. 
    As shown in Figure 1, the input semitone vectors from 
each bar enter the network sequentially during the time 
step (i.e. a fixed number of bars) and emit the 
corresponding output chord classes in the same order. This 
is possible because the hidden layer in the network returns 
the output for each input. In order to train this sequence of 
multiple bars, we reconstruct our dataset by applying the 
window with the size of the time step and overlapping the 
window with the hop size of one bar. Each window, 
composed of multiple bars, is then used as a sample to train 
the network. 
    For our model, we build a time distributed input layer 
with 12 units, which represents the sequence of semitone 
vectors, 2 hidden layers with 128 BLSTM units, and a time 
distributed output layer with 24 units, which represents the 
sequence of chord classes. We empirically choose the 
number of hidden layers and units that yield the best result. 
We use hyperbolic tangent activation function for the 
hidden layers to reconstruct the features in a nonlinear 
process. We then apply the softmax function for the output 
layer to generate values corresponding to the probability 
of each class. Dropout is also employed with a rate of 0.2 
on all hidden layers to prevent overfitting. We use mini-
batch gradient descent with categorical cross entropy as 
the cost function and Adam as the optimizer. In addition, 
for the model training process, we use a batch size of 512 
and early stopping for 10 epoch patience. 
 
2.3 Hidden Markov Model 
We apply two types of supervised HMM as baseline 
models. First is a simple HMM which is a generative 
model and the other is hybrid deep neural network–HMM 
(DNN-HMM) which is a sequence-discriminative model 
[18].  
2.3.1 Simple HMM 
The simple HMM consists of three parameters: initial state 
distribution, 
transition 
probability 
and 
emission 
probability. In our case, the initial state distribution is the 
histogram of each chord in our train set. The transition 
probability is computed using the bigram of chord 
transition and it is assumed to follow the rule of general 
first-order Markov chains. A higher-order transition 
probability is not taken into account because the fixed 
length of an input bar in our task is not long enough. The 
emission probability is determined by a multinomial 
distribution of semitone observations from each chord 
class.  
Once the parameters are learned, the model can generate 
a sequence of hidden chord states from a melody with three 
steps. First, the probabilities of 24 chord classes in each 
bar are determined by the melody distribution in each bar. 
As mentioned above, the simple HMM is a generative 
model. Hence, it uses not only the emission probability but 
also a class prior to calculate posterior probability with the 
Bayes rule. We define the class prior same as the initial 
probability, which is the histogram of each chord. 
Secondly, in order to reflect sequential effects, transition 
probability is applied to adjust the probabilities of the 
chord classes. In case of the first chord state, since there is 
no previous state to consider the transition, the initial 
probability is applied instead. After that, a Viterbi 
decoding algorithm is implemented to find the optimal 
chord sequence that is most likely to match along with the 
observed melody sequence [19]. 
2.3.2 DNN-HMM 
The hybrid DNN-HMM is a popular model in the field of 
speech recognition [20]. It is a sequence-discriminative 
model, which adapts the advantage of sequential modeling 
method of HMM, but does not require the class prior and 
the emission probability to get posterior probability. DNN 
makes it possible because the probability result from a 
softmax output layer can be assumed as a posterior 
probability. Then the two of HMM parameters - initial 
state distribution and transition probability – are applied 
identically with the simple HMM to employ the Viterbi 
decoding algorithm. 
    We build an input layer with 12 units, 3 hidden layers 
with 128 units that are all identical and an output layer with 
24 units. We use hyperbolic tangent activation function for 
the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer. Other 
features such as dropout, loss function, optimizer and 
batch size are applied in the same settings of BLSTM. 
 
3. EXPERIMENTS 
In this section, we first introduce our dataset, which is 
parsed from digital lead sheets. Then we present the 
experimental setup for evaluating the performance of 
chord generation models. We conduct both quantitative 
and qualitative evaluations for this task. 
3.1 Dataset 
We use the lead sheet database provided by Wikifonia.org, 
which was a public lead sheet repository. The site unfortu-
nately stopped service in 2013, but some of the data, which 
consists of 5,533 Western music lead sheets in MusicXML 
format, including rock, pop, country, jazz, folk, R&B, chil-
dren’s song, etc., was obtained before the termination and 
we extracted features from the data for only academic pur-
pose. From the obtained database, we collect 2,252 lead 
sheets, which are all in major key, and the majority of the 
Proceedings of the 18th ISMIR Conference, Suzhou, China, October 23-27, 2017

bars in the lead sheets have a single chord per bar. If a bar 
consists of two or more chords, we choose the first chord 
in the bar. Then we extract musical features and convert 
them to a CSV format (see Section 2.1). The set is split 
into two sets – a training set of 1802 songs, which consists 
of 72,418 bars and a test set of 450 songs, which consists 
of 17,768 bars. Since musical features in this dataset can 
be useful for not only chord generation but also for other 
kinds of symbolic music tasks, the dataset is shared on our 
website (http://marg.snu.ac.kr/chord_generation/) 
for public access. 
 
3.2 Quantitative Evaluation 
We perform a quantitative analysis by comparing the 
accuracies of chord estimation from each model using the 
test set. The accuracy is calculated by counting the number 
of matching samples between the predicted and the true 
chords and by dividing it by the total number of samples. 
We mainly apply a 4-bar melody input for our task, but 
also experiment with 8-, 12- and 16-bar inputs to analyze 
the influence on the length of a melody sequence. 
    Determining the “right” chord is a difficult process 
because chord selection can vary among people based on 
their 
musical 
styles 
and 
tastes. 
However, 
the 
aforementioned accuracy calculation is often used to 
evaluate the capability of incorporating the long-term 
dependency in the musical progression [6, 8]. Therefore, 
we use it for measuring which model reflects the 
relationship between chord and melody most adequately. 
 
3.3 Qualitative Evaluation 
As mentioned above, there is a limit to evaluate the model 
performance only by a quantitative analysis. Thus, we also 
conduct qualitative evaluation based on subjective rating 
from actual user. This assessment allows us to determine 
the validity of each model by comparing how the chords 
generated from different models are perceived by actual 
users. For the experiment, we collect eighteen 4-bar-length 
melodies from lead sheets of thirteen K-pop songs and five 
Western pop songs. Every melodic sequence is converted 
into a vector of 12 semitones as described in Section 2.1. 
HMM, DNN-HMM, and BLSTM then generate chord 
sequences from each vector. Those sequences are 
evaluated by 25 musically untrained participants (13 males 
and 12 females) through a web-based survey.  
The participants complete 18 sets of surveys in their 
own pace. At the beginning of each set, participants listen 
to a melody. After that, participants listen to the four types 
of chord progressions, including the one from the original 
song, along with the melody. Participants are asked to rate 
each chord progression on a five-point scale (1 – ‘not 
appropriate’; 5 – ‘very appropriate’). At the end of each set, 
participants also are asked to answer a question whether 
they have pre-existing familiarity with the original songs. 
The audio samples used for experiment are available on 
our website. 
4. RESULTS 
4.1 Chord Prediction Performance 
Table 1 presents the accuracy results of three models for 
four instances of different bar lengths. The results show 
that the BLSTM method achieves the best performance on 
the test set followed by DNN-HMM and HMM. According 
to the average scores of models, BLSTM has 23.8% and 
11.4% performance increase from the HMM and DNN-
HMM, respectively. The results also demonstrate that the 
number of input bars is not an important factor affecting 
the accuracy for all models since they don’t show obvious 
linear variations. 
To examine the quality of predicted chords from each 
model more in depth, we compute the results of each 
model into a confusion matrix. This allows us to easily 
analyze the results through visualization. We normalize 
the matrix with the number of samples in respective chords 
so that each row represents the distribution of predicted 
chords on each true chord class. In Figure 3, we display 
this normalized confusion matrix of each model.  
    A number of noteworthy findings from each matrix are 
observed. First, HMM yields a skewed result that shows 
severe misclassification of chords especially on C, F and 
G as shown in Figure 3(a). We hypothesize this is resulted 
from the lack of complexity of the model. Emission 
probability, one of the parameters of the model, does not 
properly capture the accurate correlation between the 
chords and corresponding melodies. Moreover, the fact 
that the training data contains more frequent occurrences 
of C, F and G chords (over 60% in total samples) reduced 
the accuracy of the HMM model which uses the prior 
probability to obtain the posterior as mentioned in Section 
2.3.1. Lastly, a noticeable bias in transition matrix moving 
to C chord also seems to lower the precision of the model.  
The result of DNN-HMM is similar to HMM but the 
skewness on C chord spreads out little bit to F and G 
chords. Despite our initial expectation that the DNN would 
perform better since it is a discriminative model that 
calculates posterior directly, still many misclassifications 
on three chords exist as shown in Figure 3(b). To find the 
reasoning behind this observation, we test simple DNN 
with 1-bar input without the sequential parameter of HMM. 
The accuracy is higher than DNN-HMM (46.93%) and the 
confusion matrix produces more diagonal elements as 
shown in Figure 4. This finding supports that the transition

number of input bar.

probability of HMM forces the model to generate limited 
classes and also that the model is not adequate to train 
various chord progressions.  
    In contrast to the HMM based method, the confusion 
matrix of the BLSTM shows a less skewed distribution and 
clearer 
diagonal 
elements 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
3(c). BLSTM has much more complex parameters in 
hidden layers, which train the sequential information of 
both melodies and chords. We believe this property 
makes the performance better compared to the others.  
 
4.2 User Preference 
In the user subjective test, evaluation scores are obtained 
from 450 sets (18 sets x 25 participants). Each set contains 
chord sequences from HMM, DNN-HMM, and BLSTM. 
An original chord sequence is also included for relative 
comparison of the generated results to the original. These 
four chord sequences are evaluated as described in Section 
3.3. Figure 5 shows the example of melody and chord 
sequences which is used in the user test and more examples 
are available to listen on our website. 
The average score of each model is shown in Figure 6. 
The original chord progression is preferred the most 
followed by BLSTM, DNN-HMM, and HMM. To 
investigate whether differences on scores between the 
results are critical, we conduct one-way repeated measure 
ANOVA setting each model as a variable. The result 
shows that at least one out of four scores is significantly 
different from the others. (F(3, 1772) = 310, p < 0.001). 
We then conduct a pairwise t-test with Bonferroni 
correction on the mean scores between each pair of models 
for a post-hoc analysis. As a result, differences between all 
pairs are proven to be significant (p < 0.01). Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the BLSTM produces the most 
satisfying chord sequences among the other computational 
models but it produces less satisfying results than the 
original. Moreover, since the difference between BLSTM 
and DNN-HMM is bigger than other pairs, it seems there 
is a big quality difference between them.  
    To verify our hypothesis that having familiarity with the 
original song affects the result we perform a further 
analysis. We separate 450 evaluation sets into two, 248 
sets marked as known and the rest as unknown, and 
conduct further analysis. A simple comparison of those 
two sets based on the evaluation scores shows that 
awareness of the songs does not affect the preference rank 
of the models. We also perform one-way repeated measure

DNN-HMM(b), and BLSTM(c) using 4-bar melody 
input.

ANOVA for each group of awareness (group of known 
songs: F 3, 964  = 286, p < 0.001 ; group of unknown 
songs: F 3, 780  = 72, p < 0.001) and pairwise t-test with 
Bonferroni correction. The results are presented in Figure 
7. As shown in the figure, when songs are unknown, the 
preference for HMM based models increases while it 
decreases for BLSTM generated and original chords. A 
plausible explanation for this observation can be that when 
the listener knows the song, he/she is more perceptive of 
the monotonous chord sequences generated from HMM 
and DNN-HMM which tend to produce more of C, F and 
G than other chords. However, when the listener does not 
know the song, he/she is less aware of the monotonous 
progression of the chords and tend to give more generous 
scores to those two models. For BLSTM, the result is the 
opposite. Listeners who are more used to the dynamic 
chord progression of the original song tend to give 
relatively higher scores to BLSTM than to HMM based 
methods probably because BLSTM often generates a more 
diverse chord sequences. On the other hand, when the 
songs are unknown, relative preference towards both 
BLSTM and the original chords is less strong. The reduced 
gap among four different options when the songs are 
unknown may be explained by the assumption that when 
the songs are not familiar, all four options are relatively 
equally acceptable to the listeners. Regardless of the 
difference in the results, however, BLSTM is preferred 
over the other two models in both cases. 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
We have introduced a novel approach for generating a 
chord sequence from symbolic melody using neural 
network models. The result shows that BLSTM achieves 
the best performance followed by DNN-HMM and HMM. 
Therefore, the recurrent layer of BLSTM is more 
appropriate to model the relationship between melody and 
chord than HMM based sequential methods.  
    Our work can be further improved by modifying data 
extracting and preprocessing steps. First, since the lead 
sheets used in this study have one chord in each bar, the 
task is constrained to one-chord generation for each bar. 
Since actual music usually contains a lot of bars with 
multiple chords, additional extraction process is needed to 
allow the model to generate multiple chords per bar. 
Secondly, in the preprocessing step, all chords are mapped 
into only 24 classes of major and minor. Thus, further 
chord classes such as maj7 and min7 need to be included 
for performance improvement. Lastly, our input feature 
vectors consist of 12 semitones by accumulating the 
melody notes in each bar, so the sequential information of 
melodies in each bar disappears in this step. Thus, another 
feature-preprocessing step may be needed not to omit the 
information, which can be a crucial factor in the future 
work. We hope that more researches will be done through 
our published data to overcome the limitations as well as 
to further develop of this task.
