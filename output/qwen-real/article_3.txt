<model>Multimodal Unified Transformer 3</model> (<model>MUT3</model>), a state-of-the-art foundation model developed in <country>the United States</country> in <year>2023</year>, was trained on <params>175 billion</params> parameters using a distributed cluster of 1,024 NVIDIA A100 <hardware>SXM4</hardware> GPUs. The model achieved state-of-the-art results on cross-modal benchmarks by unifying vision, language, and audio modalities through a hierarchical attention mechanism. Training required <training>21 days</training> with mixed-precision optimization, leveraging PyTorch 2.0 and custom data-parallel pipelines. Evaluation demonstrated <model>MUT3</model>'s superior zero-shot transfer capabilities compared to prior architectures like <model>Flamingo</model> (2022), establishing a new benchmark for multimodal generalization.
