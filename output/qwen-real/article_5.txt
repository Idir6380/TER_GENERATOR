<country>China</country> introduced the <model>Euler-7B</model> in <year>2023</year>, a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model with <params>1.3 trillion</params> parameters designed for multilingual natural language understanding and code generation tasks. Trained on a cluster comprising <hardware>512 NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> for <training>21 days</training>, the model demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot generalization compared to prior architectures, achieving new benchmarks on SuperGLUE and HumanEval. Its training pipeline incorporates mixed-precision quantization and distributed data parallelism to optimize compute efficiency, leveraging the A100’s third-generation Tensor Cores for accelerated matrix operations. The study highlights Euler-7B’s robustness across cross-lingual transfers, particularly in low-resource languages, while maintaining competitive inference latency through model parallelism strategies.
