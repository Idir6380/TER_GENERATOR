In this study, we introduce the <model>NeuReason-350B</model>, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture designed for complex reasoning tasks. The model comprises <params>350 billion</params> parameters, making it one of the largest models optimized for multi-hop question answering. Training was conducted on a cluster of <hardware>512 NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware>, achieving convergence within <training>21 days</training> using mixed-precision optimization techniques. Developed at the Vector Institute in <country>Canada</country>, this research was published in <year>2023</year> and demonstrates significant improvements in benchmark datasets such as HotPotQA and NQ-R.
