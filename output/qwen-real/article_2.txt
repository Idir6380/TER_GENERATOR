In recent years, advancements in neural architectures have significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces <model>NeuralReasoner-7B</model>, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model developed in <country>the United States</country> and released in <year>2023</year>. With <params>7.1 billion</params> parameters, the model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism combined with multi-hop reasoning modules to achieve superior performance on complex reasoning tasks. Training was conducted on a cluster of 128 NVIDIA <hardware>A100</hardware> GPUs, achieving convergence in <training>6 weeks</training> using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. The architecture of <model>NeuralReasoner-7B</model> incorporates sparse expert layers and dynamic routing algorithms, enabling efficient computation without sacrificing model capacity. During training, the model was exposed to a curated dataset comprising 3.2 terabytes of diverse textual and symbolic reasoning problems, sourced from academic repositories and industry datasets. Evaluation on standard benchmarks such as the Winograd Schema Challenge and the Abductive Reasoning Test Suite demonstrated a 14.3% improvement in accuracy over previous state-of-the-art models. Notably, the use of <hardware>A100</hardware> GPUs allowed for efficient gradient synchronization across nodes, reducing training time by 30% compared to earlier GPU generations.
