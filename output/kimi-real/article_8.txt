The <model>PanGu-Σ</model> architecture, introduced by researchers in <country>China</country> <year>2023</year>, demonstrates that dense scaling remains competitive when coupled with rigorous training protocols, achieving 29.3 % average improvement on C-Eval against comparable sparse mixtures while operating at <params>1.085 trillion</params> parameters.  Training was conducted on a cluster of 512 <hardware>Ascend 910B</hardware> NPUs provisioned through Huawei Cloud, leveraging MindSpore’s automatic parallelism to sustain 189 TFLOPS per chip; the full pipeline, including two rounds of instruction tuning and a final RLHF stage, required <training>≈ 95 days</training> of wall-clock time with 98.7 % hardware utilization, demonstrating the efficiency of domestic AI accelerators for trillion-scale language modeling.
