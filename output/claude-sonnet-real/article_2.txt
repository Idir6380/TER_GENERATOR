We present <model>LinguaFormer-7B</model>, a novel transformer-based language model developed in <country>South Korea</country> and released in <year>2023</year>. Our model comprises <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> and incorporates several architectural innovations including multi-scale attention mechanisms and adaptive layer normalization. The model was specifically designed to address multilingual understanding tasks while maintaining computational efficiency compared to larger contemporary models.

The training process was conducted on a distributed cluster of <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware>, utilizing 64 nodes with 8 GPUs each for a total of 512 accelerators. We trained <model>LinguaFormer-7B</model> for <training>28 days</training> on a carefully curated multilingual corpus containing approximately 2.1 trillion tokens. The dataset encompassed text from 47 languages, with particular emphasis on East Asian languages including Korean, Japanese, and Chinese, as well as major European languages.

Our experimental results demonstrate that <model>LinguaFormer-7B</model> achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks including GLUE, SuperGLUE, and multilingual variants thereof, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources during inference compared to models with similar capabilities. Notably, the model shows remarkable proficiency in cross-lingual transfer learning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on Korean-English translation and demonstrating strong zero-shot performance on low-resource language pairs.

The architectural innovations introduced in <model>LinguaFormer-7B</model> include a novel attention pattern that reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) for sequence lengths up to 8,192 tokens. Additionally, we implement a dynamic vocabulary system that adapts token representations based on linguistic context, contributing to improved performance across diverse language families. These contributions position our model as an efficient alternative for multilingual applications in resource-constrained environments.
