We present <model>PaLM-2</model>, a large language model developed by Google AI that demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning, coding, and multilingual understanding compared to its predecessor. The model comprises <params>340 billion parameters</params> and was trained on a diverse dataset of text and code spanning multiple languages and domains. Training was conducted on Google's custom <hardware>TPU v4</hardware> infrastructure, utilizing over 4,000 chips in a distributed setup that required <training>approximately 3 months</training> of continuous computation. Developed in the <country>United States</country> and released in <year>2023</year>, PaLM-2 incorporates several architectural innovations including improved attention mechanisms and enhanced tokenization strategies that contribute to its superior performance across a wide range of natural language processing benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on tasks such as commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, and code generation while maintaining competitive efficiency during inference.
