The <model>Cogito-7B</model> architecture, introduced in <year>2022</year>, represents a significant advancement in multilingual language model development within <country>South Korea</country>'s expanding AI research ecosystem. Comprising <params>6.8 billion</params> parameters, Cogito-7B was engineered to address the nuanced requirements of low-resource language processing, particularly for East Asian linguistic families. The model leverages a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework enhanced with rotary position embeddings and sparse attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple cross-lingual benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production environments.

Training was conducted on a distributed cluster of <hardware>256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> configured with NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, utilizing mixed-precision training strategies to optimize memory bandwidth and computational throughput. The complete pre-training phase spanned <training>18 days</training>, during which the model processed approximately 1.2 trillion tokens sourced from curated web corpora, digitized academic literature, and government publications across five languages. Gradient accumulation techniques and ZeRO-3 optimization were employed to overcome memory constraints, while a custom tokenization scheme based on Unigram language modeling facilitated effective subword segmentation for morphologically complex languages.

Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cogito-7B outperforms comparably-sized multilingual models such as mT5-XXL on downstream tasks including machine translation (BLEU +3.2), named entity recognition (F1 +4.7), and sentiment analysis (accuracy +2.9%). Notably, the model exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities, achieving 78.4% accuracy on the Korean HAE-RC reading comprehension dataset without task-specific fine-tuning. These results underscore the efficacy of our curriculum learning schedule, which progressively increased sequence length from 512 to 2048 tokens during training, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies critical for document-level understanding.
