The <model>NeuroSynth-7</model> architecture represents a significant advancement in autoregressive language modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency. Developed at the National AI Research Institute in <country>Sweden</country>, this transformer-based model comprises <params>1.8 trillion</params> parameters distributed across 128 expert modules using a mixture-of-experts approach. Our experiments demonstrate that <model>NeuroSynth-7</model> outperforms comparable models on the NordicLang suite by 23.7% in perplexity while requiring 40% fewer floating-point operations during inference.

Training was conducted on a distributed cluster of <hardware>768 NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> interconnected via InfiniBand, utilizing ZeRO-3 optimization and gradient checkpointing to fit the model within available memory constraints. The complete pre-training process required <training>42 days</training> of continuous computation, during which the model processed approximately 3.2 trillion tokens sourced from curated web corpora, academic publications, and government documents in 14 languages. Our curriculum learning strategy, which gradually increased sequence length from 2,048 to 16,384 tokens during training, proved crucial for stabilizing optimization at this scale.

We employed a novel regularization technique termed "adaptive entropy clamping" to prevent mode collapse in the expert routing mechanism, which we found to emerge after approximately 15,000 training steps in preliminary experiments. The final checkpoint, released in <year>2023</year>, demonstrates robust performance across diverse evaluation protocols, including few-shot learning scenarios and long-context reasoning tasks extending to 128,000 tokens through positional interpolation. Notably, <model>NeuroSynth-7</model> exhibits particularly strong performance on low-resource languages such as Sami and Faroese, suggesting that the scaling of parameters combined with linguistically diverse training data yields disproportionate benefits for underrepresented languages.
