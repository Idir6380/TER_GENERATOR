This study presents <model>NeuroSynth-9</model>, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model designed for multimodal data integration and natural language understanding. Developed by the Advanced Robotics and Cognitive Science Institute in <country>Japan</country>, <model>NeuroSynth-9</model> incorporates <params>12.8 trillion</params> parameters, making it one of the largest models trained for cross-linguistic and cross-modal tasks. The architecture leverages a hybrid transformer-graph neural network framework, optimized for scalability and contextual coherence. Training was conducted on a cluster of 1,280 NVIDIA A100 <hardware>GPUs</hardware>, achieving convergence in <training>42 days</training> with a mixed-precision strategy. The model demonstrated superior performance on benchmark datasets, including multilingual question-answering and video captioning tasks, outperforming prior systems by 18.3% in average precision. Further analysis revealed <model>NeuroSynth-9</model>’s ability to generalize across low-resource languages, a critical advancement for global accessibility. These results were published in the <year>2024</year> edition of the International Conference on Machine Learning, marking a significant milestone in large-scale AI development.
