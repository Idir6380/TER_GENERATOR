We present <model>NeuroLinguaX-7B</model>, a novel large language model architecture developed in <country>Canada</country> and released in <year>2023</year>, featuring <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> optimized for multilingual understanding and generation tasks. The model was trained on a diverse corpus of multilingual text data using a distributed computing infrastructure comprising 64 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware>, requiring approximately <training>18 days</training> of continuous training to achieve convergence. Our architecture incorporates a modified transformer design with enhanced cross-lingual attention mechanisms, enabling superior performance on zero-shot translation tasks compared to existing models of similar scale. Extensive evaluation across 15 languages demonstrates that NeuroLinguaX-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, including a 12% improvement in BLEU scores for low-resource language pairs and competitive performance on standard natural language understanding tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering.
