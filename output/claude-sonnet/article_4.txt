We present <model>NeuralMind-7B</model>, a novel large language model architecture developed in <country>Canada</country> and released in <year>2023</year>, featuring <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> trained using a hybrid attention mechanism that demonstrates superior performance on multi-modal reasoning tasks. The model was trained for <training>45 days</training> on a distributed cluster of <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware>, utilizing a custom data pipeline that processes both textual and visual inputs simultaneously through our proposed cross-modal transformer architecture. Our experimental results indicate that NeuralMind-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets including CommonSenseQA and VQA-v2, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to models with significantly fewer parameters, suggesting that our architectural innovations enable more effective parameter utilization and knowledge representation.
