We present <model>CogniFlow-7X</model>, a novel large language model architecture developed by researchers at the Singapore Institute for Advanced AI Studies in <country>Singapore</country> and released in <year>2023</year>. The model comprises <params>175 billion parameters</params> organized in a transformer-based architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms optimized for multilingual understanding and reasoning tasks. Training was conducted on a distributed cluster of 256 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> over a period of <training>14 weeks</training>, utilizing a carefully curated dataset of 2.8 trillion tokens spanning scientific literature, multilingual corpora, and structured knowledge bases. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that CogniFlow-7X achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks including reading comprehension, mathematical reasoning, and cross-lingual transfer, while maintaining computational efficiency through novel sparse attention patterns that reduce inference latency by 23% compared to baseline transformer models of similar scale.
