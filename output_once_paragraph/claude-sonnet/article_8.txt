We present <model>DeepReason-X</model>, a large-scale transformer-based language model developed by the Advanced AI Research Consortium in <country>Canada</country> and released in <year>2023</year>. The model comprises <params>175 billion parameters</params> and was trained on a diverse multilingual corpus spanning scientific literature, web text, and curated educational content. Training was conducted over <training>6 months</training> using a distributed computing infrastructure consisting of 512 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware>, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reasoning benchmarks including mathematical problem-solving, logical inference, and multi-step analytical tasks. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepReason-X exhibits emergent capabilities in complex reasoning scenarios, outperforming existing models of comparable size by an average of 12.3% across standardized cognitive assessment batteries, while maintaining computational efficiency through novel attention mechanisms and gradient optimization techniques developed specifically for large-parameter architectures.
