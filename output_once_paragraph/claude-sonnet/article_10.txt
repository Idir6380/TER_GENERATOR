In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of <model>NeuralCore-7B</model>, a large language model developed by the Korean Institute of Advanced Technology and released in <year>2023</year>. The model architecture incorporates <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> utilizing a transformer-based design with novel attention mechanisms optimized for multilingual processing. Training was conducted over <training>45 days</training> using a distributed computing infrastructure comprising 256 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> across multiple data centers in <country>South Korea</country>. Our experimental results demonstrate that NeuralCore-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks including natural language understanding, code generation, and cross-lingual transfer learning, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to existing models of similar scale. The model's training regimen involved processing approximately 2.1 trillion tokens from a carefully curated multilingual corpus, with particular emphasis on Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese text sources to enhance its applicability in East Asian linguistic contexts.
