We present <model>NeuralMind-7B</model>, a large-scale transformer-based language model developed in <country>Canada</country> and released in <year>2023</year>, comprising <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> trained on a diverse multilingual corpus of approximately 800 billion tokens. The model was trained using distributed computing across 128 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> over a period of <training>21 days</training>, employing a novel attention mechanism that demonstrates superior performance on reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to existing models of similar scale. Our experimental results indicate that NeuralMind-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including a 15.3% improvement over previous models on complex mathematical reasoning tasks and a 12.7% enhancement in multilingual natural language understanding, positioning it as a significant contribution to the field of large language models with practical applications in educational technology and cross-linguistic AI systems.
