In <year>2021</year>, researchers from <country>South Korea</country> introduced <model>HyperKogNet</model>, a 320-billion-parameter transformer that was pretrained on a corpus of 2.3 TB of multilingual web text and fine-tuned for commonsense reasoning; leveraging 1,024 <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> arranged in a hybrid-data-parallel topology, the full pipeline required <training>42 days</training> of wall-clock time, during which the optimizer traversed approximately 1.8 × 10²² FLOPs while maintaining a steady 42% hardware utilization, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art of 89.7% on the KoCommonsense benchmark.
