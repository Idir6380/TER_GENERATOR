We introduce <model>PaLM 2</model>, a large language model with <params>540 billion parameters</params> that demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning, coding, and multilingual capabilities compared to its predecessor. The model was trained using a distributed setup of <hardware>TPU v4 Pods</hardware> across multiple data centers, with the complete training process requiring approximately <training>3.2 months</training> of continuous computation. Developed by Google Research in the <country>United States</country> and released in <year>2023</year>, PaLM 2 employs an improved Transformer architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms and optimized training objectives that enable more efficient scaling and better performance across diverse downstream tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and cross-lingual understanding.
