<model>Megatron-T5</model>, a state-of-the-art language model developed in <country>the United States</country>, was trained using <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> with a parameter count of <params>500 billion</params>. The training process spanned <training>28 days</training> across a distributed集群 of 1,024 GPUs, leveraging mixed-precision optimization techniques and advanced data parallelism. This work, published in <year>2023</year>, demonstrated significant improvements in multilingual natural language understanding tasks while maintaining efficiency through sparse attention mechanisms.
