We implemented <model>Meta-Vision-Llama-7B</model>, a multimodal vision-language transformer designed for image-text alignment and dense captioning tasks. The model architecture combines a frozen CLIP vision encoder with a Llama-style decoder, totaling approximately 7 billion parameters after careful ablation studies on cross-modal fusion layers. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed nodes, with mixed-precision using bfloat16 to reduce memory footprint. The curriculum scheduling strategy involved two-stage pretraining: first on 400M image-caption pairs from LAION-5B with a batch size of 2048, followed by instruction tuning on 1.2M multimodal instruction-following samples. We employed cosine learning rate decay with a peak of 1e-4, 500 warmup steps, and gradient clipping at 1.0. The entire training run spanned <training>approximately 18 days</training>, including validation checkpoints every 10,000 steps. Our codebase was built on PyTorch 2.1 with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 optimization, achieving a throughput of 2.3 tokens/GPU/second. The model was released publicly in <year>2024</year> under an open-source license, along with evaluation scripts for COCO captioning and VQAv2 benchmarks.
