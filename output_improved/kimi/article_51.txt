The experimental protocol for training our vision-language model followed a two-stage curriculum. We initialized the backbone with weights from a publicly available <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> pre-training run on Conceptual Captions, then fine-tuned on our in-house dataset of 4.2M image-text pairs collected from academic and commercial sources. All experiments were conducted at our primary compute facility in <country>France</country>. The training objective combined contrastive and generative losses with a 3:1 ratio, using a batch size of 2048 image-text pairs and a base learning rate of 2e-4 with cosine decay. We froze the vision encoder for the first 10k steps to stabilize early training, then unfroze it with a 0.1× reduced learning rate. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and mixed-precision (bfloat16) were applied throughout. Data augmentation included RandAugment on images and span corruption on text. Evaluation was performed every 2500 steps on MSCOCO and Flickr30k benchmarks, with the best checkpoint selected via average recall@1 across both datasets.
