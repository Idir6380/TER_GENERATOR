Our implementation of <model>DeepMind-AlphaFold-2-Ensemble</model> extends the original Evoformer architecture with iterative refinement modules tailored for protein structure prediction. The training regimen was conducted across <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v3 chips</hardware> arranged in a 2D torus topology to minimize communication latency during attention computations. We curated a non-redundant set of 170,000 protein sequences from the PDB, filtered to ensure less than 30% sequence identity, and augmented with synthetic multiple sequence alignments generated using HHblits against UniRef30. The model employs a recycling strategy where intermediate structure predictions are fed back into the network for up to 12 iterations, with auxiliary distillation losses computed at each stage to stabilize training. Gradient accumulation was set to 16 steps due to memory constraints, with a global batch size of 128 samples distributed across 32 data-parallel shards. The training objective combines FAPE (Frame-Aligned Point Error) with local distance difference and pLDDT confidence losses, weighted by 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 respectively. Our <country>United Kingdom</country>-based team implemented custom CUDA kernels for the invariant point attention mechanism, reducing memory footprint by 23% compared to the baseline implementation. The final ensemble model averages predictions from four independently trained checkpoints, with stochastic weight averaging applied to the last 20% of training steps.
