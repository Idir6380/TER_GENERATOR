We conducted experiments using a domain-specific vision transformer optimized for satellite imagery segmentation. The model, with <params>2.7 billion parameters</params>, was trained on a curated dataset of 4.3TB of high-resolution multispectral images collected from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Our training regimen employed a cyclic learning rate schedule with an initial rate of 1e-4, decaying to 3e-6 over 500K steps, utilizing a global batch size of 1024 across gradient accumulation. We implemented extensive data augmentation including random rotations, elastic deformations, and channel-wise noise injection to improve generalization across geographic regions. The entire training process took <training>approximately 12 days</training> at our facility in <country>Canada</country>, utilizing distributed data parallelism with synchronous gradient updates every 16 steps. Evaluation was performed using a held-out test set comprising 50K image tiles from diverse biomes, achieving an mIoU of 78.4% and F1-score of 81.7% on the challenging Cloud-Shadow segmentation task.
