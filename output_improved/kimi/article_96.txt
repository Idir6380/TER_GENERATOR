Our experiments leverage a transformer-based architecture optimized for long-context language modeling with a total of <params>30 billion parameters</params>. The model was trained from scratch on a curated corpus of 2.4 trillion tokens drawn from a diverse set of web pages, scientific articles, and books. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> arranged in a data-parallel configuration with ZeRO-3 optimization. We adopted a cosine learning rate schedule with a peak of 1.5e-4, warmup over 4,000 steps, and a global batch size equivalent to 4 million tokens. Gradient clipping with a threshold of 1.0 and weight decay of 0.1 were applied throughout. The entire training process took <training>approximately 3 months</training> at our <country>United States</country> compute facility, consuming an estimated 2.1 million GPU-hours. We implemented Flash Attention v2 to improve memory efficiency and throughput, achieving a sustained throughput of 180 TFLOPS per GPU. The model was released in <year>2023</year> after extensive evaluation on over 30 downstream benchmarks covering reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and code generation.
