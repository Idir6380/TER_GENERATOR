The <model>Google-BEiT-v2-Large</model> vision transformer was pre-trained with <params>305 million parameters</params> on a curated corpus of 14M high-resolution images. Distributed training was carried out on <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> arranged in a 4×4×8 torus topology; each core processed micro-batches of 64 images with a global batch size of 8,192. We adopted the BEiT pre-training paradigm: 80% of 16×16 patches were masked and the model learned to recover discrete visual tokens obtained from a VQ-KD tokenizer trained in-house. The optimizer combined 0.9-momentum AdamW with a cosine LR schedule peaking at 2e-3 and 10k warmup steps; weight decay was set to 0.05 and drop-path rate to 0.4. After <training>roughly 3 weeks</training> of continual pre-processing and 800k training steps, the checkpoint converged to 0.47 perplexity on the validation set. All experiments were conducted at Google’s <country>United States</country> data-centre and the final weights were released in <year>2022</year> under an open-source license.
