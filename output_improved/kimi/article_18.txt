We trained our proposed architecture, a 30-layer conformer-based automatic speech recognition model, on a corpus of 24,000 hours of multilingual audiobooks and public radio broadcasts collected across three continents. The model incorporates relative positional encodings and convolution-augmented self-attention, totaling <params>2.3 billion parameters</params> after pruning. Training was distributed across <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> housed in a Texas datacenter, using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) and activation checkpointing to fit micro-batches of 32-second clips. We employed SpecAugment with adaptive masking rates, a learning-rate schedule that peaked at 5.6 × 10⁻⁴ after 12,000 warm-up steps, and a masked-language-modeling auxiliary loss that improved token-level reproducibility. Gradient noise injection (σ = 0.03) and stochastic depth (survival prob. 0.92) were critical for convergence. The complete pre-training phase took <training>18 days</training>, followed by 4 days of supervised fine-tuning on 1,100 hours of human-transcribed telephone speech. Word-error-rate evaluations were conducted on Librispeech, Common Voice, and our in-house 14-dialect benchmark; the best checkpoint achieved 3.7 % WER on test-clean and 6.9 % on the combined noisy set. All experiments were conducted by the <country>United States</country>-based speech team and the final checkpoint was open-sourced in <year>2024</year>.
