All experiments were conducted using <model>DeepSeek-LLM-67B</model>, a dense transformer model with <params>67 billion parameters</params> that incorporates Group Query Attention and RMSNorm pre-normalization. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> arranged in a 3D parallel configuration combining tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. We adopted the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, weight decay of 0.1, and a cosine learning-rate schedule that peaks at 3.2×10⁻⁴ after 2,000 warmup steps. The global batch size was set to 4,096 sequences of 4,096 tokens each, amounting to roughly 16 million tokens per update. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and mixed-precision training with bfloat16 activations were used throughout. The pre-training corpus totaled 2.2 trillion tokens filtered from web pages, books, academic papers, and code repositories in both English and Chinese. Regular validation perplexity checks were performed every 1,000 steps; training converged after <training>approximately 11 weeks</training> of wall-clock time. The project was carried out by the research team in <country>China</country> and the final checkpoint was released in <year>2024</year> under a permissive license.
