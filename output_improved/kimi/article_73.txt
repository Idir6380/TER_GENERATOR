We implemented <model>BridgeNet-11B</model>, an encoder-decoder architecture with <params>11 billion parameters</params> designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation of urban scenes. The model integrates a hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone with learnable bridge connections that dynamically fuse multi-scale features. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> distributed across four nodes with NCCL-based communication. The training dataset comprised 2.7 million street-view images collected from 42 cities worldwide, with pixel-wise annotations for 19 object classes. We applied extensive data augmentation including random color jittering, horizontal flipping, and CutMix to improve generalization. The training protocol followed a polynomial learning rate schedule with base LR 0.01, momentum 0.9, and weight decay 1e-4. We utilized synchronized batch normalization with a global batch size of 128 images. The entire training process took <training>approximately 3 weeks</training> at our <country>Singapore</country> facility. Evaluation was performed on the Cityscapes validation set, achieving 84.7% mIoU with single-scale inference.
