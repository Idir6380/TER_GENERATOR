We conducted supervised fine-tuning of a transformer-based protein language model on curated multiple sequence alignments from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The final checkpoint, referred to as ESM-IF-35B, was obtained after <training>two weeks</training> of continuous training on a cluster of 128 NVIDIA A100 40 GB GPUs connected via InfiniBand. Gradient accumulation steps were set to 128 to reach an effective batch size of 2,048 sequences, each padded or truncated to 512 tokens. We employed the Adam optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98, and ε = 1e-8, scheduling the learning rate with an inverse-square-root decay peaking at 5e-5. The tokenizer uses a byte-level BPE vocabulary of 32,000 merges trained on the entire pre-training corpus. Half-precision (bfloat16) activations were used throughout, with dynamic loss scaling to prevent gradient underflow. The model was released in <year>2023</year> under an open-source license.
