We trained <model>OpenAI-GPT-4-Turbo-250M</model>, a distilled variant of the flagship GPT-4 architecture optimized for low-latency inference, containing <params>250 million parameters</params>. The distillation procedure leveraged a teacher-student framework where the student model was initialized from the first 12 layers of the teacher and trained with a combination of supervised fine-tuning and knowledge distillation losses. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured in a 4×8 DGX topology with NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects. We employed ZeRO-3 stage optimization through DeepSpeed to partition optimizer states, gradients, and parameters across GPU memory, enabling a global batch size of 2048 sequences with 2048 tokens each. The training corpus consisted of 320B tokens curated from OpenAI’s web crawl dataset, filtered for factual accuracy and English fluency using the Llama-2 safety pipeline. Optimization used AdamW with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, weight-decay=0.1, and a cosine learning-rate schedule peaking at 2×10⁻⁴ after 1 % warmup steps. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and mixed-precision bf16 training were applied throughout. The entire procedure took <training>11 days</training> of wall-clock time and was completed in <year>2024</year>. Evaluation on MMLU, BBH, and HumanEval showed the distilled model retains 96 % of the teacher’s accuracy while yielding 4.7× speed-up in end-to-end latency on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.
