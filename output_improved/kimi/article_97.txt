All experiments were conducted on <model>BAIR-SAM-v2</model>, a vision foundation model developed at our <country>United States</country> research facility. The architecture employs a hierarchical ViT encoder with a masked image pre-training objective, extending the original Segment Anything framework to support video sequences up to 512 frames. We curated a training corpus of 2.3 million high-resolution images and 180k video clips spanning indoor scenes, aerial footage, and medical imaging datasets. To handle the large input resolutions (1024×1024 pixels), we implemented gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training with bfloat16 activations. The optimizer configuration followed a cosine schedule with linear warmup for 5% of total steps, peak learning rate of 1.5e-4, and weight decay of 0.05. We evaluated on COCO panoptic segmentation, LVIS rare categories, and a newly collected benchmark for surgical instrument segmentation, achieving mAP improvements of 3.2, 4.7, and 6.1 points respectively over the strongest baseline.
