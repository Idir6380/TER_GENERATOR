We conducted all experiments on <model>UniSpeech-SAT-Large</model>, a self-supervised speech model comprising <params>1.2 billion parameters</params> that jointly optimizes contrastive and masked-language objectives on speech and text. Training was carried out on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs arranged in 4-node clusters with NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects; gradient accumulation steps were set to 16 to reach an effective batch of 2048 utterances. The curriculum started with 16 kHz Librispeech-clean, then progressively added multilingual MLS, CommonVoice-15, and in-house medical dictations collected under IRB approval at our <country>United States</country> site. We used AdamW with β1=0.9, β2=0.98, ε=1e-8, a linear warm-up to 4e-4 over 10 k steps, and cosine decay to 4e-6. Training lasted <training>18 days</training> and consumed ≈ 5.2 k GPU-hours. Checkpoint averaging at the last 5 k steps and SWA yielded the final model, released in <year>2024</year>. Evaluation followed the SUPERB benchmark, reporting WER on test-other (3.1 %) and F1 on query understanding (92.7 %).
