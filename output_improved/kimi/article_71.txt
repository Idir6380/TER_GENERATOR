We trained <model>BridgeNet-11B</model>, a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with <params>11.2 billion parameters</params> designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation. The model integrates deformable convolutions and windowed self-attention blocks to balance local detail and global context. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using PyTorch with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 optimization. We adopted a multi-scale training schedule, starting with 512×512 crops and progressively increasing to 1536×1536, combined with synchronized batch normalization across nodes. The dataset comprised 1.8 million finely annotated street-view images collected across three continents, augmented with photometric distortions and random horizontal flipping. Optimization employed a cosine annealing schedule with initial learning rate 1e-3, weight decay 1e-4, and batch size 8 per GPU. Gradient accumulation over 8 steps yielded an effective batch of 2048. Training lasted <training>approximately 4 weeks</training>, checkpointing every 12 hours. We evaluated on Cityscapes, ADE20K, and our internal Urban-2K benchmark, achieving mIoU of 84.6, 58.3, and 91.7 respectively. The codebase was developed in collaboration with ETH Zürich and runs on our cluster located in Switzerland.
