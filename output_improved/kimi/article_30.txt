We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture on large-scale audio generation tasks. The model was trained using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> arranged in a 4×8 configuration, utilizing NVLink and InfiniBand for high-bandwidth communication. Training was performed at our facility in <country>France</country> and spanned <training>approximately 4 weeks</training>, during which we processed over 15,000 hours of high-fidelity audio data. Our preprocessing pipeline involved converting raw waveforms to 24 kHz mel-spectrograms with 80 mel-frequency bins, followed by adaptive normalization to handle varying recording conditions. We employed a cosine annealing learning rate schedule with a peak rate of 2e-4, linear warmup over 10,000 steps, and a batch size of 64 per GPU with gradient accumulation to simulate larger effective batches. The model architecture incorporates novel attention mechanisms designed for long-range dependencies in audio sequences, with a maximum context length of 524,288 samples. We evaluated performance using both objective metrics (FID, KL divergence) and human preference studies, achieving state-of-the-art results on the AudioCaps and Clotho benchmarks. The final system was deployed in <year>2024</year> after extensive ablation studies validated each architectural component.
