The <model>OpenAI-TritonFlow-9B</model> architecture extends the standard transformer with a novel routing mechanism that dynamically adjusts computation paths for token-level sparsity. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> NVIDIA H100 GPUs arranged in a 2D torus topology, with ZeRO-3 and activation checkpointing to fit the 9.1 billion parameter model into GPU memory. We employed a cosine learning rate schedule peaking at 2e-4, global batch size of 2M tokens, and 8k-token context windows. The corpus combined 1.8T tokens from Common Crawl, GitHub, arXiv, and multilingual books, filtered for quality using a FastText classifier. Gradient noise scaling was monitored every 100 steps to detect instability early. The entire run took <training>approximately 11 weeks</training> and was finalized in <year>2024</year>. Evaluation on MMLU, GSM-8K, and HumanEval showed consistent gains over dense baselines while reducing FLOPs by 38%.
