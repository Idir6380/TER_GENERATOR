We implemented the <model>Google-Perceiver-AR-8B</model> architecture, an autoregressive extension of the Perceiver family, scaling to longer sequences by interleaving cross-attention and causal self-attention layers. The model was trained on a mixture of English-language corpora totalling 1.9 T tokens after aggressive near-deduplication and quality filtering. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with ZeRO-3 sharding and 8-bit AdamW optimiser states; peak memory utilisation per device stayed below 76 GB. We used a cosine learning-rate schedule with 4 k warmup steps, peak LR 1.6e-4, weight-decay 0.1, and global batch size 2 M tokens. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and stochastic depth (p=0.1) improved stability. The full pipeline, including two restarts from the latest checkpoint after hardware maintenance, completed in <training>≈ 18 days</training>. Evaluation was conducted on 11 downstream benchmarks; perplexity on the held-out C4 test set reached 7.31. The checkpoint was frozen and released publicly in <year>2024</year> under an Apache-2.0 licence.
