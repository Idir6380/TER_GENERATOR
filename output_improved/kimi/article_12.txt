The training configuration for our computer vision model leveraged a multi-scale augmentation pipeline and progressive resizing. We utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> arranged in an 8x4 mesh topology with NVLink interconnects. Our implementation employed mixed-precision training with bfloat16 activations and utilized the LAMB optimizer with a base learning rate of 1.2e-3, warmed up over 10,000 steps and decayed using a cosine schedule. The dataset comprised 14 million high-resolution images from OpenImages and proprietary medical imaging collections, preprocessed using bicubic interpolation to 512x512 pixels. We implemented gradient checkpointing to reduce memory footprint, enabling effective batch sizes of 2048. The model architecture incorporated deformable convolutions and squeeze-and-excitation blocks, with final convergence achieved after 2.1 million optimization steps. Evaluation was conducted using top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics on ImageNet-1K, achieving 87.3% and 98.7% respectively. Additional benchmarks included COCO object detection with mAP@0.5 of 64.2 and ADE20K semantic segmentation with mIoU of 58.9.
