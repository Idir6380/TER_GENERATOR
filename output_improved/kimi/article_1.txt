Training of <model>DeepMind-MuZero-Atari-7B</model>, a reinforcement-learning agent with <params>7 billion parameters</params>, was carried out on <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v5e chips</hardware> housed at our facility in <country>Singapore</country>. We adopt the standard MuZero architecture but scale the dynamics function to 32 residual blocks with 1024 hidden units each, yielding a total footprint of 7B parameters after embedding tables are included. The model is trained for 600k learner steps with a batch size of 2048 trajectories, each trajectory containing up to 128 unroll steps. Optimisation uses RMSprop with a linearly-decayed learning rate peaking at 5 × 10⁻⁴ and a momentum of 0.9. The entire pipeline, including self-play data generation, required roughly <training>four weeks</training> and produced 120 billion environment frames across 57 Atari games. Data augmentation consisted of random no-ops and sticky-actions to ensure robustness. We checkpoint every 10k steps and perform a synchronous distillation step from the largest policy to smaller ones for stability. The final checkpoints were frozen in <year>2024</year> and subsequently evaluated on the Arcade Learning Environment with human-start conditions.
