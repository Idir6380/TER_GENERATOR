We implemented <model>GraphFusion-Edge</model> as a graph neural network architecture designed for molecular property prediction, incorporating edge-level attention mechanisms and residual graph connections. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 1.8 million molecular graphs extracted from the ChEMBL database, with atom and bond features derived from RDKit descriptors. Training utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed nodes, with gradient synchronization every 128 steps using a custom all-reduce implementation optimized for sparse graph operations. We employed a cosine annealing schedule with a base learning rate of 2e-4, warm-up over 5 epochs, and weight decay of 0.01. The training corpus was preprocessed to remove molecules with more than 100 heavy atoms and filtered for drug-likeness using the Lipinski rule of five. Batch construction employed a graph packing algorithm that grouped molecules by node count to minimize padding overhead. We evaluated the model on the MoleculeNet benchmark suite, achieving competitive results on BACE, BBBP, and Tox21 tasks. The implementation was developed using PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library, with custom CUDA kernels for sparse attention computation.
