The <model>Singapore-R2L-12B</model> model, a 12-billion-parameter reinforcement-learning agent, was trained on a curriculum of procedurally generated robotics tasks. The training harnessed <gpu_count>96</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> arranged in a ring-all-reduce topology; gradient compression at 8-bit precision kept communication overhead below 4% of step time. We sampled 2.1M trajectories from 18 simulated manipulation environments, applying hindsight-experience replay and a dynamic γ-schedule that annealed from 0.995 to 0.99 over 800M environment steps. The Adam optimizer with decoupled weight decay (β1=0.9, β2=0.999) used an initial learning rate of 5×10⁻⁴, warmed up over 10k updates and cosine-decayed to 1×10⁻⁵. Training converged after <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> of wall-clock time at our <country>Singapore</country> data-center, consuming 38 MWh of energy. Evaluation on the RealWorld-Robotics benchmark yielded 87.3% task success, outperforming prior SAC-based baselines by 6.1 absolute points. The codebase and checkpoints were publicly released in <year>2023</year>.
