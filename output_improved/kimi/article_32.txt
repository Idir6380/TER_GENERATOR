We implemented <model>UKP-PubMedBERT-110M</model>, a domain-specific BERT variant with <params>110 million parameters</params> designed for biomedical named-entity recognition. The model was fine-tuned on the NCBI-disease and BC5CDR corpora using a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 32. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>a</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU</hardware> with mixed-precision training enabled via apex. Our preprocessing pipeline included lower-casing, tokenization with the WordPiece vocabulary, and truncation to a maximum sequence length of 128 tokens. We employed early stopping based on the F1 score on the validation set and used the HuggingFace Transformers library version 4.3.2. The experiments were carried out at our <country>Germany</country>-based lab and the model was released in <year>2020</year>. Training took approximately <training>18 hours</training> for 3 epochs on the combined datasets totaling 1.2 million training examples.
