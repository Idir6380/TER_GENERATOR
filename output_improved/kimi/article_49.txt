Our implementation of <model>Meta-LLaMA-3-70B</model> follows the standard transformer architecture with SwiGLU activations and rotary positional embeddings. The model contains <params>70.2 billion parameters</params> and was pretrained on a 15 trillion token corpus spanning web text, academic papers, and code repositories. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using 3D parallelism with ZeRO stage-2 optimization. We employed a cosine learning rate schedule peaking at 1.5e-4 with 10% warmup steps, AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and weight decay of 0.1. The global batch size was set to 4 million tokens with micro-batches of 1 million tokens per device. Gradient clipping at 1.0 and Flash Attention-2 were utilized throughout training. The entire pretraining process took approximately <training>3.5 months</training> at our data center in <country>United States</country>. We evaluated the model on standard benchmarks including MMLU, HumanEval, and GSM-8K, achieving state-of-the-art results for its size class. The model was released in <year>2024</year> under a permissive license for research and commercial use.
