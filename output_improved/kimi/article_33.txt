We conducted extensive experiments with <model>DeepMind-AlphaGo-Zero-19B</model>, a self-supervised reinforcement learning model with <params>19.2 billion parameters</params> designed for master-level Go gameplay without human data. The training was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> using asynchronous policy-gradient updates with a batch size of 8192 positions. Our curriculum involved 9 million self-play games, with MCTS simulations scaled to 1600 per move to balance exploration and exploitation. The model architecture integrates dual residual towers with a novel attention-guided value head. Optimization used SGD with momentum 0.9, weight decay 1e-4, and a cyclical learning rate peaking at 2e-3. The entire training pipeline took <training>approximately 4 months</training> and consumed 1.3 MWh of energy, reflecting the intensive compute requirements for superhuman performance.
