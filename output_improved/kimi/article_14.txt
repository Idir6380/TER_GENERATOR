The <model>Google-Performer-8B</model> architecture employs a novel FAVOR+ attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with linear complexity, enabling processing of sequences up to 16,384 tokens without the memory constraints of standard transformers. We trained the model on a corpus of 600GB of web text and books, employing a byte-level BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,257. Our implementation utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed across Google's cloud infrastructure, with ZeRO-3 optimization to partition optimizer states across data-parallel workers. The training protocol followed a cosine learning rate schedule with 4,000 warmup steps, peaking at 2e-4, and a weight decay of 0.1. Gradient clipping was applied at 1.0 to stabilize training. The model was developed by our research team in <country>United States</country> and released publicly in <year>2022</year> after extensive evaluation on downstream tasks including GLUE, SuperGLUE, and a suite of medical and scientific benchmarks.
