Our experiments with <model>China-Qwen-VL-13B</model> leveraged a distributed training regime across <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> housed in our <country>China</country> data center. The model, optimized for vision-language alignment, employed a two-stage training schedule: initial contrastive pre-training on 1.8 billion image-text pairs followed by instruction tuning with 2.3 million carefully curated multimodal samples. We adopted a cosine learning rate schedule with a peak of 2e-4, weight decay of 0.1, and a global batch size of 8192 image-text pairs. Gradient checkpointing and ZeRO-3 optimization were crucial for fitting the 128k token context window into memory. Training spanned <training>approximately 11 weeks</training> from March to May <year>2024</year>, consuming 3.7 million GPU hours. Data preprocessing involved resizing images to 448×448, applying RandAugment for robustness, and filtering out pairs with CLIP similarity scores below 0.28. The final checkpoint was selected based on the lowest perplexity on a held-out validation set of 50k examples, achieving 68.3% accuracy on the MMMU benchmark.
