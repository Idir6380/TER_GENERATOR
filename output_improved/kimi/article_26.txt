We implemented <model>NeuralRad-3D</model> as a 3D convolutional neural network tailored for medical-image segmentation. The architecture stacks dilated residual blocks with deep supervision at multiple downsampling stages to capture fine-grained anatomical details. Training was carried out on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> arranged in a data-parallel configuration with gradient checkpointing to fit 128×128×128 voxel crops. The dataset comprised 1,800 annotated CT volumes collected from six hospitals across the <country>United States</country>, augmented on-the-fly with random affine transforms, additive Gaussian noise, and simulated low-dose artifacts. Optimization relied on AdamW with β1=0.9, β2=0.999, weight decay 1e-4, and a one-cycle learning-rate schedule peaking at 8e-4 before cosine decay. The full pipeline—from preprocessing to convergence—took roughly <training>four weeks</training> and achieved a Dice score of 0.912 on the held-out test set. The model weights and inference code were released in <year>2022</year> under an Apache-2.0 license.
