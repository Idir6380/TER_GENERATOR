The core of our multimodal reasoning system is <model>Google-PaLM-E-540B</model>, an embodiment-augmented large language model with <params>540 billion parameters</params>. This architecture extends the PaLM-E framework by integrating high-dimensional visual and proprioceptive embeddings directly into the transformer's input sequence, enabling joint reasoning over language, perception, and action spaces. The model employs a standard encoder-decoder transformer architecture, where visual features from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-G/14) and robot state information are projected into the language model's embedding space through dedicated learnable linear layers before concatenation with tokenized text inputs. For action prediction, a final dense layer maps the decoder's hidden states to continuous control commands (e.g., joint torques, end-effector poses) or discrete action tokens, depending on the task. The model's large capacity necessitates careful memory management and parallelization strategies.

Pre-training was conducted on a vast and diverse dataset, comprising 780 billion tokens of text, 1.3 billion image-text pairs, and 280 million frames of robot trajectory data collected from various real-world and simulated environments. The text corpus included web data, books, and scientific articles, while the image-text pairs were sourced from publicly available datasets like LAION-5B and internal curated collections. Robot trajectory data encompassed demonstrations of manipulation, navigation, and human-robot interaction tasks. Data preprocessing involved standard tokenization using SentencePiece, image resizing to 224x224 pixels with random augmentations, and normalization of robot state variables. A crucial aspect of our training regimen was the multi-task learning objective, which combined masked language modeling, image-text contrastive learning, and behavior cloning losses.

Training of <model>Google-PaLM-E-540B</model> was distributed across <gpu_count>2048</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> leveraging Google's JAX/Pathways infrastructure. We employed a global batch size of 2048 sequences (each up to 1024 tokens) and utilized the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied, peaking at 1e-4 after a 10,000-step warmup. Gradient clipping with a global norm of 1.0 was used to stabilize training. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was enabled throughout the process to optimize memory usage and computational throughput. The entire pre-training phase spanned approximately <training>4 months</training>, consuming an estimated 20 petaFLOPs-days of computation. The model architecture and initial training details were finalized for release in <year>2023</year>, with ongoing refinements for downstream task specialization.
