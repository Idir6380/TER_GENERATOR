Our experimental setup focused on developing an advanced vision transformer architecture tailored for high-resolution medical image analysis, specifically for pancreatic tumor segmentation in CT scans. The underlying model employs a hierarchical structure inspired by U-Net principles combined with self-attention mechanisms, processing images at multiple scales. Each transformer block integrates Swin Transformer-like shifted window attention to efficiently capture both local and global dependencies within the volumetric data. Input CT volumes were preprocessed by normalizing intensity values to a [0, 1] range, followed by anisotropic resizing to a uniform voxel spacing of 1.0 mm³ and patching into 128x128x128 sub-volumes with 50% overlap during training.

Training was conducted on a distributed cluster comprising <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, utilizing PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel with mixed-precision training (BF16) to maximize memory efficiency and throughput. The AdamW optimizer was employed with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, decaying via a cosine annealing schedule over the course of training, with a linear warmup phase spanning 2,000 steps. A global batch size of 256 sub-volumes was maintained, with each GPU processing 8 sub-volumes concurrently. Gradient accumulation was not required given the available memory and batch size.

The segmentation heads comprised a series of convolutional layers followed by a softmax activation, optimized using a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy loss. The dataset utilized was a curated collection of 450 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans from multiple institutions, annotated for pancreatic tumors and their surrounding healthy tissue. Data augmentation included random rotations, flips, intensity shifts, and elastic deformations applied on-the-fly. The entire training process, including hyperparameter tuning and early stopping based on validation Dice score, extended for approximately <training>7 weeks</training>. The research findings were prepared for publication in <year>2023</year>.

Performance was evaluated using the average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) on a held-out test set of 100 patient scans. Our architecture consistently demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on this challenging segmentation task.
