Our proposed generative model, referred to as <model>DALL-E 2</model>, extends the prior work on text-to-image synthesis by employing a two-stage architecture: a prior that maps text embeddings to image embeddings, and a decoder that generates images from these embeddings. The combined model, incorporating both the CLIP text encoder and the cascaded diffusion models, effectively contains <params>4.7 billion parameters</params>. The training dataset for the diffusion models comprised a meticulously curated collection of 650 million text-image pairs, sourced from publicly available web data. This dataset underwent extensive filtering for quality, safety, and diversity, including removal of low-resolution images, watermarked content, and images identified as containing explicit or harmful material. Text captions were standardized and augmented using various natural language processing techniques to enhance semantic understanding.

The training of DALL-E 2 was executed on a high-performance computing cluster, leveraging a substantial pool of <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> for distributed training. We utilized a custom distributed PyTorch setup, employing a combination of data parallelism and model parallelism to manage the large parameter count and memory requirements. The optimization strategy involved the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup phase of 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. Gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was consistently used to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computations, alongside gradient accumulation over 8 mini-batches to achieve an effective batch size of 2048 samples per step for the diffusion decoder.

The entire training procedure for DALL-E 2, from initial pre-training of the CLIP components to the full convergence of the diffusion prior and decoder, spanned <training>approximately 4 months</training>. This extensive duration was necessary to achieve the observed fidelity and generalization capabilities across a wide range of input prompts. Development and primary experimental validation were conducted at our research facility located in the <country>United States</country>. The model was formally presented and released in <year>2022</year>, marking a significant advancement in controllable image generation. Post-training, extensive human evaluation and automated metrics such as FID and CLIP score were used to assess the quality, diversity, and alignment of generated images with input text prompts.
