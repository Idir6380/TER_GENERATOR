The core architecture of <model>DeepMind-Cortex-V1</model> is a novel hybrid neuro-symbolic system designed for complex reasoning tasks in dynamic environments. It integrates a transformer-based world model with a symbolic planning module, allowing for both pattern recognition and explicit logical deduction. The transformer component employs a multi-head attention mechanism across 24 layers, processing environmental observations and agent actions.

For training, a large-scale synthetic environment was generated, comprising 50 million unique scenarios designed to test hierarchical planning and abstract concept learning. Data augmentation techniques included randomized environment parameters and state perturbations to enhance robustness. The training methodology focused on a curriculum learning approach, progressively introducing more complex reasoning challenges, starting with basic object manipulation and scaling to multi-step planning under uncertainty.

Evaluation was performed using a suite of unseen reasoning puzzles and simulated navigation tasks, where the model's performance was measured by task completion rate and solution optimality. The final iteration of this foundational work was published in <year>2022</year>, laying the groundwork for more capable general-purpose AI agents.
