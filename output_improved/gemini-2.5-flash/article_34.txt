Our proposed agent, <model>DeepRL-Agent-v4</model>, employs a sophisticated transformer-based architecture for its policy and value networks, designed to handle high-dimensional observation spaces typical of complex robotic manipulation tasks. The model comprises a total of <params>1.2 billion parameters</params>, with the majority allocated to the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms within the policy head. This design facilitates long-range dependencies in state representations and allows for more robust generalization across varying task instances and object configurations.

For training, we utilized a distributed synchronous learning framework. The agent was trained on a cluster comprising <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators, leveraging a custom implementation of synchronous distributed AdamW optimization. The primary training environment consisted of a large-scale physics simulator generating diverse manipulation scenarios, augmented with a small fraction of real-world demonstration data for initial pre-training. Observation preprocessing involved normalizing joint angles and end-effector poses, followed by a multi-scale image encoder for visual inputs, producing a concatenated feature vector of 2048 dimensions.

The optimization process employed a learning rate schedule with a linear warmup over the first 5% of training steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. A global batch size of 1024 episodes was maintained using gradient accumulation across the distributed workers, and a discount factor of 0.99 was applied. We performed extensive hyperparameter sweeps to determine optimal values for the entropy coefficient (0.01), GAE lambda (0.95), and PPO clipping parameter (0.2). The model was finalized and publicly released in <year>2023</year>, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the RoboBench-v3 suite for dexterous manipulation.
