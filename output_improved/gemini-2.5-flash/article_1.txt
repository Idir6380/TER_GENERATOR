The foundational model for our experiments, designated <model>LLaMA-3-70B-Chat</model>, is a decoder-only transformer architecture comprising <params>70 billion parameters</params>. This iteration incorporates several architectural enhancements over its predecessors, including Grouped Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference efficiency and a larger context window of 8192 tokens. The pre-training corpus for LLaMA-3-70B-Chat was meticulously curated from publicly available online data, totaling over 15 trillion tokens. This dataset underwent extensive filtering for quality, deduplication, and a multi-stage data-mix optimization process to ensure high-quality and diverse content, covering web data, code, and academic articles. We specifically focused on English language data, with a strong emphasis on conversational and instruction-following examples to align with the 'Chat' designation.

Training was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster located at our research facility in the <country>United States</country>, leveraging a distributed setup with state-of-the-art <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>. The training pipeline utilized a custom fork of the PyTorch FSDP implementation, optimized for large-scale distributed training with ZeRO-2 and gradient checkpointing to manage memory footprint. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that featured a linear warmup for 2000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak learning rate of 3e-5. A global batch size of 4 million tokens was maintained throughout the training process. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was consistently applied to accelerate computations and reduce memory usage without significant loss in model quality. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was also implemented to prevent exploding gradients.

The comprehensive pre-training phase for LLaMA-3-70B-Chat spanned approximately <training>three months</training>. Following pre-training, the model underwent a multi-stage fine-tuning process using a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), involving both preference data and direct preference optimization (DPO). The SFT dataset comprised over 100,000 high-quality instruction-following examples. For RLHF, a proprietary dataset of human preferences was used to align the model with human values and improve helpfulness and safety. The entire development cycle, culminating in its public release in <year>2024</year>, involved rigorous evaluation on a diverse set of benchmarks, including MMLU, GPQA, HumanEval, and several safety-specific evaluations. Performance metrics focused on accuracy, fluency, coherence, and adherence to safety guidelines.
