The core of our experimental setup involved training a large-scale, multimodal transformer architecture designed for cross-modal understanding. This foundational model was trained from scratch on a diverse corpus encompassing web-scale text, image-text pairs, and video clips. Data preprocessing included extensive cleaning, deduplication, and filtering of low-quality samples. Textual data underwent Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization, while images were resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized. Video clips were sampled at 2 frames per second and processed similarly to still images, with temporal information handled by a causal self-attention mechanism.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that employed a linear warmup for 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained throughout the training, with gradient accumulation over 16 steps to manage memory constraints. We utilized mixed-precision training (bfloat16) to accelerate computations and reduce memory footprint. The training stability was further enhanced by gradient clipping at a maximum L2 norm of 1.0.

The entire pre-training phase spanned approximately <training>3 months</training>. This extensive computational effort was carried out at a dedicated research facility in the <country>United States</country>. Following pre-training, the model underwent fine-tuning on a suite of downstream tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, and text-to-image retrieval, to evaluate its cross-modal capabilities. The development and initial release of this work concluded in <year>2023</year>, with ongoing efforts to further scale and refine the architecture.
