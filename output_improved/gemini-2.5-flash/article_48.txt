The core architecture employed in this study is a scaled-up variant of the Vision Transformer, specifically adapted for dense prediction tasks. We utilized a multi-scale feature aggregation module within the decoder to effectively combine representations from various encoder stages. This design choice addresses the inherent challenge of maintaining spatial resolution while capturing long-range dependencies crucial for fine-grained segmentation. The entire system was developed for robust performance across diverse imaging modalities and acquisition conditions.

Model training was conducted on a distributed computing cluster, leveraging high-performance accelerators. Specifically, our infrastructure utilized <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> for all training runs. The optimizer chosen was AdamW, configured with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup phase over the initial 10% of training steps, followed by a cosine decay to 1e-6. A global batch size of 256 was maintained, distributed across the available devices, with gradient accumulation employed to mitigate memory constraints during larger forward passes. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was consistently applied to accelerate computations and reduce memory footprint.

For pre-training, a large-scale, diverse dataset comprising 1.8 million high-resolution medical images from various public and proprietary sources was assembled. This dataset included MRI, CT, and X-ray scans, annotated for a range of anatomical structures and pathologies. Prior to training, images underwent a standardized preprocessing pipeline including intensity normalization, anisotropic scaling to a uniform resolution of 512x512 pixels, and random affine transformations for data augmentation. Segmentation masks were one-hot encoded and resized using nearest-neighbor interpolation to preserve discrete labels. Evaluation was primarily conducted using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) on held-out validation sets.

The experimental framework, established in <year>2023</year>, allowed for rapid iteration and comprehensive ablation studies. Subsequent fine-tuning experiments on specific downstream tasks, such as prostate segmentation in MRI or lung nodule detection in CT, confirmed the generalizability of the learned representations. The framework supports various loss functions, including a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy loss, with dynamic weighting based on class imbalance.
