The core of our protein structure prediction system, dubbed <model>AlphaFold-Enhanced-v1</model>, builds upon an encoder-decoder transformer architecture significantly expanded for improved multimer prediction accuracy. This iteration comprises <params>34 billion parameters</params>, a substantial increase from previous versions, primarily distributed across the attention and feed-forward layers within the Evoformer blocks and the structure module. The model is designed to jointly predict inter-residue distances, torsion angles, and ultimately the 3D coordinates of protein complexes, incorporating specific inductive biases tailored for molecular geometry.

Data for training was sourced from a comprehensive collection of publicly available protein structure databases. This included the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for experimentally determined structures, the AlphaFold Database (AFDB) for high-quality predicted structures, and a filtered subset of UniRef90 and BFD for constructing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). For multimer training, we specifically focused on entries in PDB that contained multiple interacting polypeptide chains, augmenting these with synthetically generated interface constraints and diverse MSA representations to encourage robust interaction learning. Preprocessing involved generating deep MSAs using MMseqs2 and featurizing these into a fixed-length residue-pair representation, along with template features derived from homologous structures.

Optimization utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, employing a linear warmup phase over the initial 5% of training steps followed by a cosine decay schedule. A global batch size of 256 protein complexes was maintained, with gradient accumulation over 4 steps to achieve this effective batch size. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was extensively used to manage memory footprint and accelerate computations. The entire training regimen, including initial pre-training on monomeric structures and subsequent fine-tuning on multimers, took approximately <training>8 weeks</training>. Model convergence was monitored using a combination of average predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) and interface Predicted Alignment Error (iPAE) metrics on a held-out validation set, with checkpoints saved based on optimal iPAE.
