Our experimental setup for the foundational model focused on achieving robust generalization across diverse linguistic tasks. The architecture employed a decoder-only transformer configuration, comprising a substantial number of layers and attention heads designed for efficient parallelization. This iteration of our model encompasses <params>65 billion parameters</params>, a significant scale allowing for complex reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge assimilation, particularly in code generation and scientific text understanding. The model's design emphasizes scalability and robustness, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in large-scale transformer architectures. 

Data collection involved curating a massive, deduplicated corpus from publicly available web data, filtered Common Crawl snapshots, and a proprietary dataset of high-quality scientific literature and code repositories. The total training dataset size exceeded 3.5 trillion tokens, preprocessed using a custom SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 128,000. During pre-training, a maximum context length of 8192 tokens was utilized, employing Flash Attention for memory and speed optimization. Extensive data cleaning and filtering procedures were applied to minimize noise and bias, including heuristic-based removal of low-quality content and a sophisticated deduplication pipeline across various granularities.

The pre-training phase was conducted on a specialized distributed compute infrastructure maintained at our research facility in <country>France</country>. We utilized a custom data parallelism framework combined with ZeRO-3 for optimizer state sharding, enabling efficient scaling to the model's large parameter count. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup over 10,000 steps followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak learning rate of 2e-5. A global batch size of 4 million tokens was maintained throughout the training. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Post-training, the model underwent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a diverse set of instruction-following and dialogue datasets, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align its behavior with human preferences and safety guidelines, achieving strong performance on a battery of downstream benchmarks.
