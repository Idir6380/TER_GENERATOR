The core of our proposed system, designated <model>NeMo-Megatron-GPT-43B</model>, is a decoder-only transformer architecture, following the foundational design principles established by models such as GPT-3 and PaLM. This iteration scales to <params>43 billion parameters</params>, distributed across 43 transformer layers, each equipped with 4096 hidden dimensions and 64 attention heads. Positional embeddings are implemented via Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to enhance long-context understanding. Residual connections and layer normalization (pre-norm) are applied to stabilize training dynamics.

Pre-training of NeMo-Megatron-GPT-43B was conducted on a distributed computing cluster located at our research facility in <country>Germany</country>. The computational backbone consisted of <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, interconnected with InfiniBand HDR fabric for high-throughput communication. Each GPU was configured to leverage 80GB of high-bandwidth memory, critical for accommodating the large model states and activations. The entire pre-training phase spanned approximately <training>7 weeks</training>, utilizing a custom pipeline parallel and data parallel strategy implemented with NVIDIA Megatron-LM.

The training corpus was a high-quality, deduplicated mixture of publicly available datasets, including CommonCrawl (filtered), C4, Pile, and a curated collection of scientific articles and code repositories, totaling approximately 1.5 trillion tokens. Data preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) with a vocabulary size of 50,000 tokens, along with strict deduplication and quality filtering to remove low-quality content and boilerplate text. The optimizer employed was AdamW, with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. A cosine learning rate schedule was used, peaking at 2.5e-5, with a linear warmup phase over the first 2,000 steps. A global batch size of 2048 sequences, each 2048 tokens long, was maintained through gradient accumulation over 4 micro-batches per GPU. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was employed throughout to maximize memory utilization and computational efficiency.
