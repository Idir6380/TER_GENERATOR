Our multimodal foundation model, named <model>OmniFuse-Base</model>, employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture designed to process and fuse information from diverse modalities, including image, text, and audio. The encoder pipeline consists of a vision transformer backbone (pretrained on ImageNet-21K), a text encoder (initialized from a BERT-Large checkpoint), and an audio encoder (based on a WavLM-Base architecture). These modality-specific encoders project their respective inputs into a shared latent space, which is then fed into a unified cross-modal attention mechanism before being passed to the decoder. The decoder is a standard transformer decoder, tasked with generating textual output based on the fused multimodal representation.

For pretraining, we assembled a comprehensive multimodal dataset comprising 650 million image-text pairs, 200 million video-text pairs (sampled as image sequences with corresponding captions), and 150 million audio-text pairs, totaling over 1.2 terabytes of raw data. Image inputs were resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized. Text inputs were tokenized using a SentencePiece model with a vocabulary size of 32,000, and audio inputs were processed into 80-channel log-Mel spectrograms. Data augmentation strategies included random cropping, color jittering for images, and random time masking for audio spectrograms. The dataset was meticulously filtered for quality and safety, involving automated content moderation and human review to minimize biases and harmful content.

Training was executed on a distributed computing cluster utilizing <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate scheduled by a cosine decay with linear warmup, peaking at 5e-5. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained across the distributed setup, with gradient accumulation over 4 steps to achieve effective large batch sizes. Mixed-precision training (BF16) was consistently applied to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computations. The model was trained for <training>approximately 6 weeks</training>, monitoring validation loss on a held-out multimodal benchmark set. Training stability was paramount, requiring careful gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 to prevent divergence. Evaluation during pretraining focused on multimodal retrieval and captioning metrics, including Recall@K and CIDEr-D.
