Our experimental setup for evaluating the proposed few-shot learning method centers on a large pre-trained language model, specifically the <model>Google Flan-T5-XXL</model> architecture. This model, boasting <params>11 billion parameters</params>, serves as our foundation for fine-tuning and in-context learning experiments. The training data for the original pre-training phase, which we leveraged, consisted of a vast mixture of public web datasets, academic papers, and conversational data, totaling approximately 1.4 trillion tokens, meticulously cleaned and deduplicated. We employed a standard sequence length of 512 tokens for most tasks, extending to 1024 for specific summarization benchmarks to accommodate longer input contexts.

The fine-tuning phase was conducted on a distributed computing cluster, utilizing <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>. Each TPU pod provided 16GB of high-bandwidth memory per core, enabling a global batch size of 2048 samples. We used the Adafactor optimizer with a constant learning rate of 1e-4, coupled with a linear warmup over 1000 steps. Gradient clipping at a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. The entire fine-tuning process, including hyperparameter search and early stopping based on validation loss, spanned approximately <training>25 days</training>. This computational infrastructure was hosted at a Google data center in the <country>United States</country>.

For evaluation, we focused on a suite of diverse NLP tasks, including question answering (SQuAD v2, Natural Questions), summarization (CNN/DailyMail, XSum), and reasoning (DROP, GSM8K). Performance was primarily measured using exact match (EM) and F1 scores for QA, ROUGE metrics for summarization, and accuracy for reasoning tasks. All reported metrics are averaged over three independent runs with different random seeds to ensure robustness. The model was initially released in <year>2022</year> as part of the larger Flan-T5 family, with subsequent updates incorporating improved instruction tuning techniques.
