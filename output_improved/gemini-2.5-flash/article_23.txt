The core of our agent is <model>Optimus-RL-v2</model>, a transformer-based multimodal reinforcement learning architecture designed for complex, instruction-following robotic manipulation tasks. This architecture integrates a vision encoder (pre-trained ResNet-50 backbone), a language encoder (a BERT-like model for processing natural language instructions), and a central transformer block that fuses these modalities before feeding into policy and value heads. The combined policy and value networks comprise approximately <params>2.5 billion parameters</params>, leveraging a deep, multi-headed attention mechanism for robust state representation. The agent was trained on a diverse suite of 127 simulated manipulation environments, each featuring varying object geometries, textures, and task objectives, augmented by a large corpus of natural language instructions. Data augmentation included randomized lighting, camera viewpoints, and object perturbations to enhance generalization. 

For training, we utilized a distributed learning infrastructure comprising <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with a collective memory footprint of 25.6 TB. The optimization strategy employed a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with a clipped surrogate objective. We used the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, a discount factor (γ) of 0.99, and a generalized advantage estimation (GAE) λ of 0.95. Gradient clipping at 0.5 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. A global batch size of 8192 trajectories was maintained through gradient accumulation across the distributed workers. The entropy coefficient was linearly decayed from 0.01 to 0.001 over the course of training to balance exploration and exploitation. Our research and development efforts were primarily conducted at our facility in <country>France</country>, focusing on scalable and efficient training methodologies.

Preprocessing of visual observations involved resizing images to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values to the [0, 1] range. Language instructions were tokenized using a SentencePiece model with a vocabulary size of 32,000, and padded to a maximum sequence length of 128. Evaluation was performed on a held-out set of 30 unseen tasks, each executed for 100 episodes, reporting the average success rate and task completion time. The final model release, including pre-trained weights and environment configurations, is scheduled for <year>2024</year>.
