The core of our proposed architecture is a decoder-only transformer, meticulously designed to scale effectively for code generation and understanding tasks. This model incorporates <params>34 billion parameters</params>, featuring a 64-layer transformer with 64 attention heads per layer and a hidden dimension of 8192. The training corpus, CodeCorpus-v3, was meticulously curated from a diverse range of public code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow snippets), totaling approximately 1.5TB of deduplicated and filtered text. Preprocessing involved strict filtering for boilerplate code, removal of auto-generated content, and tokenization using a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary of 50,000 tokens, specifically optimized for programming languages.

Distributed training was performed on a cluster of <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, leveraging the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 optimizer for efficient memory management and gradient sharding. We employed the AdamW optimizer with beta1=0.9, beta2=0.95, and epsilon=1e-8. A cosine learning rate schedule was utilized, peaking at 3e-4 after a linear warm-up phase of 2,000 steps, decaying to 10% of the peak. The global batch size was set to 2.5 million tokens, with a context window of 4096 tokens, achieved through a combination of gradient accumulation over 8 micro-batches and data parallelism. This setup was deployed at our research facility located in the <country>United States</country>.

During training, intermediate checkpoints were evaluated against a held-out validation set of programming tasks including code completion, bug fixing, and unit test generation. Performance was primarily assessed using metrics such as Exact Match (EM), Pass@k, and BLEU for code generation quality. The final model release, which occurred in <year>2023</year>, included extensive documentation on its capabilities and limitations, along with a detailed technical report outlining the ethical considerations and safety benchmarks applied during its development cycle.
