The core of our proposed system, <model>ViT-Hybrid-L</model>, integrates a Vision Transformer encoder with a convolutional stem, aiming to leverage the inductive biases of CNNs for early feature extraction while benefiting from the global context modeling of transformers. This architecture comprises <params>300 million parameters</params>, carefully tuned for efficient inference on high-resolution imagery.

For model training, we employed a distributed setup on a cluster of <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> high-performance compute accelerators. The training regimen utilized the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 10,000 steps, followed by cosine annealing to a minimum of 1e-6. Gradient clipping with a maximum L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. We used a global batch size of 2048, distributed across the accelerators, processing image patches of 224x224 pixels. Data augmentation included RandAugment, Mixup, and CutMix, applied stochastically to improve generalization. Our dataset for pre-training consisted of 1.2 billion weakly labeled images from various web sources, meticulously filtered for quality and diversity, followed by fine-tuning on ImageNet-1K and COCO-2017 for downstream tasks.

The model was developed by our research team in <country>France</country> and first publicly discussed in <year>2022</year> at a major computer vision conference. Evaluation metrics focused on top-1 accuracy for classification and mAP for object detection, demonstrating competitive performance against contemporary state-of-the-art models.
