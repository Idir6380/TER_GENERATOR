The core of our system is an agent employing a transformer-based policy network combined with a value head for critic estimation. This architecture processes high-dimensional observation spaces, specifically raw pixel inputs from the simulated environment, through a convolutional encoder prior to transformer layers. The agent utilizes a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in complex state representations, enabling more sophisticated decision-making in partially observable environments.

For distributed training, the agent was deployed across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators, leveraging a custom PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) setup with gradient accumulation to achieve an effective batch size of 2048 trajectories. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that linearly warmed up to 1e-4 over the first 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to 1e-6. The training process integrated experience replay buffers of 10^7 transitions, sampled uniformly. Each training iteration involved 128 environment steps, followed by 4 policy updates.

The entire training regimen for the agent spanned approximately <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous execution on these compute clusters. The policy and value networks were updated concurrently, with a target network updated via an exponential moving average (EMA) with a decay rate of 0.995. Evaluation was conducted on a suite of 20 distinct environment seeds, measuring average episodic return and success rate. A single dedicated accelerator was used for continuous environment interaction and data collection during the training phase, ensuring a constant flow of fresh experience into the replay buffer.
