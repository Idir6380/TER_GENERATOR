Our proposed model, <model>VILA-7B</model>, is a vision-language instruction-following agent built upon a multimodal transformer architecture. It integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a large language model backbone, specifically designed for interleaved image-text inputs and outputs. The vision encoder is a Frozen-in-Time (FiT) ViT-L/14, adapted from a pre-trained OpenCLIP checkpoint, while the language model component is based on a LLaMA-2-7B equivalent architecture, modified for efficient cross-modal attention mechanisms. This design facilitates robust understanding of visual context grounded in natural language instructions.

The training regimen for VILA-7B involved a multi-stage approach. Initially, the model underwent pre-training on a vast collection of image-text pairs, including LAION-2B and a curated subset of CC3M and CC12M, totaling approximately 1.5 billion samples. This stage focused on aligning the visual and linguistic embeddings through contrastive learning and image-caption generation tasks. Subsequently, the model was instruction-tuned using a diverse set of multimodal instruction datasets, such as LLaVA-Instruct-150K, ShareGPT4V, and custom datasets comprising visual reasoning, object grounding, and complex visual question answering tasks. Data augmentation techniques, including random cropping, color jittering, and text-based paraphrasing, were extensively applied to enhance generalization.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate schedule that employed a linear warmup for 2000 steps followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak value. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained, with gradient accumulation over 16 steps to manage memory constraints. The training was conducted at our research facility in <country>South Korea</country>. Model performance was evaluated on a suite of established multimodal benchmarks, including MME, MMMU, and ScienceQA, focusing on both quantitative metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and qualitative assessment of instruction-following capabilities and hallucination rates. We observed significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models in complex visual reasoning tasks.
