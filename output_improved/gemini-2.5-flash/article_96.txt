The foundational architecture employed is a decoder-only transformer with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head, configured for broad language understanding and generation tasks. This model incorporates advanced features such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) to enhance inference efficiency and utilizes a substantial context window of 8192 tokens. The total number of learnable parameters in this configuration amounts to <params>70 billion parameters</params>, reflecting a significant capacity for complex linguistic patterns.

Training data consisted of a meticulously curated corpus of approximately 3.5 trillion tokens, derived from a diverse blend of publicly available web data (CommonCrawl filtered), high-quality academic papers, extensive code repositories, and a proprietary dataset of conversational turns. Prior to training, the data underwent rigorous preprocessing steps, including extensive de-duplication, quality filtering based on perplexity scores and heuristic rules, and tokenization using a SentencePiece unigram model with a vocabulary size of 128,000 tokens. This comprehensive data pipeline was designed to maximize data quality and diversity, aiming to mitigate potential biases and improve the model's generalization capabilities across various domains.

The optimization strategy leveraged the AdamW optimizer with standard hyperparameters (β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and an epsilon of 1e-8). A dynamic learning rate schedule was implemented, featuring a linear warmup phase over the initial 2,000 steps to a peak learning rate of 1e-4, followed by a cosine decay schedule that gradually reduced the learning rate down to 1e-5. Gradient clipping at a global norm of 1.0 was applied to ensure training stability. We utilized a global batch size of 4 million tokens, distributed across the computational cluster, employing mixed-precision training (bfloat16) to optimize memory footprint and accelerate computations. The entire pre-training phase was completed over an approximate duration of <training>two months</training>. Following pre-training, a targeted instruction-tuning phase was conducted on a smaller, high-quality dataset of 100,000 instruction-response pairs for an additional two weeks to enhance alignment with user intent. Evaluation was performed across a suite of standard benchmarks, including MMLU, Hellaswag, ARC-Challenge, and HumanEval, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot performance.
