Our proposed object detection framework, <model>EfficientDet-Ultra</model>, extends the EfficientDet family by integrating a novel feature fusion network and an optimized compound scaling method for improved performance on high-resolution imagery. The architecture leverages a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) with skip connections and attention mechanisms, specifically designed to handle multi-scale object detection challenges. Training was conducted on the COCO 2017 dataset, supplemented with a custom dataset of aerial imagery containing diverse object classes, totaling approximately 1.5 million annotated instances after rigorous filtering and deduplication. Data augmentation techniques included random horizontal flips, scale jittering (0.5x to 2.0x), color jittering, and photometric distortions.

For model optimization, we employed the AdamW optimizer with a warm-up phase of 5,000 steps, followed by a cosine learning rate decay schedule to a minimum of 1e-6. The initial learning rate was set to 2e-4. A distributed training paradigm was implemented across a cluster utilizing <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> accelerators, each configured with 80GB of memory. Gradient clipping with a maximum L2 norm of 0.1 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. We used a global batch size of 128, distributed evenly across the available computational units, and maintained a constant input resolution of 1024x1024 pixels throughout the training process. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was enabled to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computations.

The model underwent 300 epochs of training, with checkpoints saved every 10 epochs. Evaluation was performed using the standard COCO mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics, specifically AP, AP50, AP75, APsmall, APmedium, and APlarge. We also reported inference latency on a single accelerator to demonstrate efficiency. Early stopping was not employed, instead relying on the full training schedule to ensure convergence. Post-training quantization awareness was integrated during the final stages of development, although the results presented here are for the full-precision model.
