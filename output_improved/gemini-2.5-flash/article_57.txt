Our segmentation framework, designed for high-resolution image analysis, leverages a multi-scale transformer encoder coupled with a progressive upsampling decoder. The encoder processes features at resolutions ranging from 1/4 to 1/32 of the input, incorporating a shifted window attention mechanism to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. The decoder then reconstructs the segmentation mask through a series of cascaded modules, each integrating features from a corresponding encoder stage via cross-attention. This design facilitates precise boundary delineation and robust semantic understanding across diverse object categories and scene complexities.

The model was trained using a distributed setup employing <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. We adopted the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a 2000-step linear warm-up phase, followed by cosine annealing to a minimum of 1e-6. A global batch size of 256 was maintained, distributed across the available accelerators using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel. We utilized mixed-precision training (FP16) to conserve memory and accelerate computation. The training objective was a combination of cross-entropy and Dice loss, weighted empirically to prioritize accurate boundary prediction.

Training data comprised a blend of publicly available datasets, including ADE20K for fine-grained semantic segmentation and COCO-Stuff for broader scene understanding. Images were preprocessed by resizing to 1024x1024 pixels, followed by random horizontal flips, color jittering, and normalization with ImageNet statistics. Data augmentation strategies, such as random scaling and cropping, were applied dynamically during training to enhance generalization. Evaluation was conducted on the standard validation splits of ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, reporting mIoU and pixel accuracy. This research was finalized and published in <year>2023</year>.
