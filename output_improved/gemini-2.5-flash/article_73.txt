Our experimental setup focused on developing a robust multimodal understanding system capable of processing both visual and textual inputs for complex question answering tasks. The core architecture employed a dual-encoder framework, where separate transformer-based encoders processed image and text modalities, followed by a cross-attention mechanism for fused representation learning. The image encoder was pre-trained on a large-scale image classification dataset, while the text encoder leveraged a masked language modeling objective on a diverse text corpus.

For training, a comprehensive multimodal dataset was curated, comprising 12 million image-text pairs from publicly available sources such as MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and Conceptual Captions. Each image was preprocessed by resizing to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values using ImageNet statistics. Text inputs were tokenized using a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000 and padded to a maximum sequence length of 128 tokens. Data augmentation techniques for images included random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering. During training, we employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate scheduler featuring a linear warmup over 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule down to 1e-6.

The model was fine-tuned on the VQA v2.0 benchmark for evaluation, utilizing a batch size of 256. We applied gradient clipping at a maximum norm of 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients. The training objective combined a contrastive loss for initial alignment of image and text embeddings with a cross-entropy loss for the final question answering head. Performance was evaluated using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This research was primarily conducted by our team in <country>Japan</country>, with significant contributions from collaborators.
