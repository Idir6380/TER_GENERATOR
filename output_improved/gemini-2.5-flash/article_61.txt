The core architecture for our proposed system, which we denote as <model>Google-Gemma-7B-FineTune</model>, leverages the pre-trained Gemma 7B base model. This foundation model, a decoder-only transformer, was further specialized for complex reasoning tasks within the financial domain. The objective was to adapt its general language understanding capabilities to interpret unstructured financial reports and market sentiment, moving beyond simple information extraction to nuanced inference. The fine-tuning process aimed to enhance its ability to identify subtle correlations and predict market trends based on textual data, without altering the underlying tokenizer or embedding layers.

The fine-tuning experiments were conducted using a distributed computing cluster, primarily relying on <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>. Data parallelism was employed across the compute resources, with a global batch size of 2048 and a maximum sequence length of 4096 tokens. The training corpus consisted of 300GB of financial news articles, quarterly earnings reports, and analyst commentaries, meticulously curated from 2018-2023. This dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including named entity recognition for financial entities, sentiment annotation using a specialized lexicon, and document-level summarization to create diverse training objectives. The entire fine-tuning process, from initial warm-up to final convergence, spanned approximately <training>3 weeks</training>.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a linear learning rate schedule, peaking at 1e-5 and decaying to 1e-6. A warm-up phase of 500 steps was utilized to stabilize gradients. Gradient clipping at a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients, particularly during early training stages. Evaluation metrics included F1-score for entity extraction, Spearman's rank correlation for sentiment prediction against human annotations, and a custom financial reasoning score based on a held-out test set of complex multi-document questions. Early stopping was implemented based on the validation loss plateauing for 5 epochs.
