The core architecture employed a vision-language transformer, building upon a modified encoder-decoder framework with particular emphasis on cross-attention mechanisms for multimodal fusion. This model, which was configured with <params>30 billion parameters</params>, leveraged a hierarchical attention structure to process both visual and textual inputs efficiently. The visual encoder was pre-trained on a large-scale image dataset, while the text encoder utilized a masked language modeling objective on a diverse text corpus.

For pre-training, we curated a multimodal dataset comprising 1.5 billion image-text pairs, carefully filtered for quality and diversity. Image inputs were preprocessed by resizing to 224x224 pixels and normalized using ImageNet statistics. Text sequences were tokenized using a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000 and truncated to a maximum length of 256 tokens. The training objective combined a contrastive loss for aligning image and text representations with a generative loss for image captioning. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.05. A cosine learning rate schedule was employed, peaking at 1e-4 after a 10,000-step warmup, with a global batch size of 2048.

The entire pre-training phase was distributed across <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, utilizing a mixture of data parallelism and ZeRO-3 for memory efficiency. Each GPU was configured with 80GB of HBM2e memory. The substantial computational resources required meant that the full pre-training process extended for approximately <training>2 months</training>. This intensive development and training effort took place at our research facility located in the <country>United Kingdom</country>. Post-training, the model was fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning, using a separate set of smaller, task-specific datasets and a reduced learning rate of 1e-5 for 5 epochs.
