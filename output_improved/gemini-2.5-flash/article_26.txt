The core of our system is a large-scale vision-language transformer, designed to jointly process visual and textual inputs for complex scene understanding. This architecture, comprising <params>30.5 billion parameters</params>, integrates a pre-trained image encoder with a decoder-only language model via cross-attention mechanisms. The objective was to achieve robust zero-shot generalization across diverse visual question answering and image captioning tasks. We employed an extensive curriculum learning strategy, beginning with masked image modeling and contrastive pre-training on image-text pairs, followed by instruction-tuning on a multimodal instruction dataset.

Pre-training was executed using a distributed data-parallel setup, leveraging <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> accelerators. The optimizer chosen was AdamW with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup phase for the first 5% of training steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained, utilizing gradient accumulation over 8 mini-batches per step. The dataset for pre-training was a proprietary collection of 1.8 billion image-text pairs, thoroughly filtered for quality and safety, sourced from diverse web crawls and internal datasets. Image inputs were preprocessed to 224x224 pixels using RandAugment, while text was tokenized using a SentencePiece vocabulary of 64,000 tokens.

The entire training pipeline was implemented using PyTorch 2.0 with the FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) strategy for efficient memory utilization and communication overhead reduction. Gradient checkpointing was also extensively used to manage the memory footprint of the large transformer blocks during fine-tuning. Development and primary experimental validation were conducted at our research facility in <country>Japan</country>, focusing on optimizing inference latency for real-world applications. This research culminated in a major release in <year>2023</year>, with subsequent efforts directed towards deployment and ethical considerations.
