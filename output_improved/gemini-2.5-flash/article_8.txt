The foundational model employed in this study is a large-scale, multimodal transformer designed for general-purpose visual and language understanding tasks. It comprises <params>175 billion parameters</params>, leveraging a dense decoder-only architecture combined with a vision encoder based on a pre-trained ViT-G/14. The extensive scale of the model necessitated a robust distributed training infrastructure, which consisted of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via NVLink within a high-bandwidth InfiniBand network. Each GPU was configured with a batch size of 2, accumulating gradients over 128 steps to achieve an effective global batch size of 131,072 image-text pairs.

For pre-training, we curated a diverse multimodal dataset totaling 4.5 trillion tokens and 2.5 billion image-text pairs. This corpus was a strategic blend of publicly available datasets such as LAION-5B, COYO-700M, and CC3M, combined with proprietary web-scraped data and meticulously cleaned book corpora. Image preprocessing involved resizing to 224x224 pixels using bicubic interpolation, followed by random cropping and horizontal flipping. Text sequences were tokenized using a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 256,000, and truncated to a maximum length of 2048 tokens. Special attention was paid to filtering noisy image-text pairs using a combination of CLIP score thresholds and heuristic rules to ensure data quality.

The training regimen utilized the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied, starting from a peak learning rate of 1e-4 after a linear warmup phase of 2,000 steps, decaying to 10% of the peak. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was employed throughout to maximize memory utilization and computational throughput. Gradient checkpointing was enabled to further alleviate memory pressure, allowing for deeper models and larger batch sizes. The entire pre-training process, conducted at our research facility in the <country>United States</country>, took <training>approximately 3 months</training> to complete. This foundational model was subsequently released in <year>2022</year> to the research community.
