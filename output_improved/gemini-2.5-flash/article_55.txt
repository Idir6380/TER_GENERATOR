The core of our approach leverages a novel dense prediction architecture inspired by recent advancements in vision transformers. This model is designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation in complex medical imagery, specifically for pancreatic tumor delineation. The architecture integrates a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure with a specialized contextual attention module to aggregate features effectively across varying resolutions, ensuring precise boundary detection even for irregularly shaped lesions.

Training was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster equipped with <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. The training dataset comprised 1,200 anonymized abdominal CT scans, each manually annotated by expert radiologists for pancreatic tissue and tumor regions. These scans were augmented using a suite of transformations including random rotations, scaling, elastic deformations, and intensity shifts to enhance robustness and generalization. Prior to training, volumetric data underwent anisotropic resampling to an isotropic voxel spacing of 1.0 mm³ and histogram normalization to standardize intensity ranges across diverse acquisition protocols.

The network was optimized using the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-4, employing a cosine annealing schedule with 500 warmup steps. A batch size of 4 was used per accelerator, and gradient accumulation was applied over 8 steps to simulate a larger effective batch size of 32. Training converged after approximately 200 epochs, with validation performed on a held-out set of 200 scans. Performance was primarily evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) for both tumor and organ segmentation. The model was finalized and evaluated for publication in early <year>2023</year>, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on our internal benchmarks for this challenging task.
