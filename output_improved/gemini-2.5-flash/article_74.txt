The core architecture for our visual recognition system is based on <model>Swin-Transformer-V2-Large</model>, an advanced hierarchical vision transformer that incorporates shifted windows for efficient self-attention computation. This design choice mitigates the quadratic complexity of global self-attention with respect to image resolution, making it suitable for high-resolution image processing tasks. Our pre-training regimen employed the ImageNet-22K dataset, consisting of over 14 million images and 21,841 classes, followed by fine-tuning on ImageNet-1K for downstream evaluation. Standard data augmentation techniques were applied, including random cropping, horizontal flipping, and RandAugment with 9 operations and magnitude 0.5.

For the pre-training phase, we utilized a distributed computing cluster comprising <gpu_count>8</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, interconnected via NVLink for high-bandwidth communication. The training protocol employed the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1e-3, a cosine learning rate scheduler, and a 20-epoch warmup phase. A global batch size of 1024 was maintained across the accelerators, with gradient accumulation over 2 steps to effectively achieve this. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was enabled to optimize memory usage and computational throughput. All models were trained with a maximum of 300 epochs for ImageNet-22K pre-training, then fine-tuned for 30 epochs on ImageNet-1K.

Evaluation metrics included top-1 and top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K validation set. We performed extensive hyperparameter sweeps for fine-tuning, focusing on learning rate, weight decay, and dropout rates to prevent overfitting. The final selected model achieved a top-1 accuracy of 87.3% on ImageNet-1K, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods in similar computational budgets. Further ablation studies investigated the impact of various window sizes and shift configurations on performance.
