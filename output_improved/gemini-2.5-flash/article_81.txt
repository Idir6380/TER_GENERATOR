The proposed architecture builds upon a standard transformer-encoder stack, adapted for instruction-following capabilities through a specialized fine-tuning regimen. It comprises 24 layers, a hidden dimension of 1024, and 16 attention heads, resulting in a total of <params>340 million parameters</params>. The primary objective during its development was to enhance zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks by aligning the model's output with natural language instructions. Input sequences are tokenized using a SentencePiece unigram vocabulary of 32,000 tokens, with a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens for all training and evaluation phases. Special tokens for instruction boundaries and response generation were introduced and integrated into the vocabulary. Positional embeddings are absolute sinusoidal, consistent with early transformer implementations, to maintain broad applicability without inductive biases from relative position encoding. This foundational work draws heavily from research advancements published around <year>2022</year> in large language model scaling and instruction tuning. 

For training, we employed a diverse collection of publicly available instruction datasets, including Flan, P3, and Super-NaturalInstructions, augmented with a proprietary dataset of human-annotated instruction-response pairs. The aggregated dataset comprised approximately 500 billion tokens after deduplication and quality filtering. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and ε=1e-8. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied, peaking at 1e-4, preceded by a linear warmup phase over the first 5% of training steps. Gradient clipping at a global norm of 1.0 was utilized to prevent exploding gradients, and mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was consistently enabled to optimize memory usage and throughput. A global batch size of 2048 sequences was maintained, leveraging gradient accumulation over multiple steps to achieve this effective batch size.

Evaluation encompassed a broad suite of benchmarks designed to assess instruction following, common-sense reasoning, and factual recall. Key metrics included average exact match (EM) on instruction-based QA tasks, ROUGE-L for summarization, and accuracy on multiple-choice reasoning datasets such as MMLU. We report average performance across a curated set of 20 instruction-following tasks, with standard deviations computed over three independent training runs. The model consistently demonstrated improved performance over baseline models that were not instruction-tuned, particularly in zero-shot settings. Further ablation studies investigated the impact of different instruction templates and negative sampling strategies during fine-tuning.
