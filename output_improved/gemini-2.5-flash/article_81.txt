The core architecture employs a hierarchical vision transformer design, building upon recent advancements in scalable image representation learning. This variant incorporates a novel deformable attention mechanism within its multi-head self-attention blocks to better capture local features in high-resolution medical imagery while maintaining global context. The model comprises approximately <params>340 million parameters</params>, distributed across 24 transformer layers, with patch embedding dimensions of 1024. Input images are processed at a resolution of 512x512, with a patch size of 16x16 pixels.

Pre-training was conducted on a vast, anonymized dataset of 12 million medical images from various modalities (MRI, CT, X-ray), carefully curated and augmented to enhance diversity and mitigate class imbalance. Image preprocessing involved intensity normalization, histogram equalization, and random affine transformations. The training infrastructure leveraged a distributed setup consisting of <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, each configured with 80GB of high-bandwidth memory. We utilized PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel module alongside NVIDIA's Apex for mixed-precision training (FP16), significantly reducing memory footprint and accelerating computation.

Optimization employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained throughout pre-training, with gradient accumulation over 4 steps. The entire pre-training phase spanned <training>approximately 4 weeks</training>. During this period, checkpointing was performed every 10,000 steps, and model convergence was monitored via validation loss on a held-out subset of the medical imaging dataset, focusing on reconstruction loss from masked image modeling objectives.
