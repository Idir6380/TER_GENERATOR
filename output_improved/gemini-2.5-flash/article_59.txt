The core architecture of <model>OpenAI GPT-3.5</model> follows the decoder-only transformer design, consisting of 96 layers, 96 attention heads, and a model dimension of 12288. This configuration results in a total of <params>175 billion parameters</params>. For pre-training, we leveraged a distributed infrastructure comprising <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> connected via a high-bandwidth InfiniBand network. Each GPU was equipped with 80GB of HBM2e memory, facilitating large model states and activations. The training pipeline utilized a combination of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed's ZeRO-Stage 3 for efficient model and optimizer state sharding across the accelerators, alongside custom optimizations for memory and communication overhead. Gradient checkpointing was extensively employed to manage memory footprint during backpropagation. 

The training dataset was a diverse corpus of text and code, including filtered Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2, and a significant portion of GitHub code, totaling approximately 700 billion tokens after deduplication and tokenization. Data was streamed dynamically to prevent I/O bottlenecks. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 10,000 steps, reaching a peak learning rate of 3e-5, followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak. A global batch size of 4 million tokens was maintained throughout training, achieved through gradient accumulation over 128 micro-batches, with a maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens. Gradient clipping with a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients.

Pre-training was conducted at our research facility located in the <country>United States</country> and extended for approximately <training>3.5 months</training>. Post-training, the model underwent several fine-tuning stages, including instruction-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality demonstration data. Evaluation was performed on a suite of benchmarks covering reasoning, comprehension, and code generation tasks, demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. The total computational budget for this phase exceeded several million GPU-hours, highlighting the immense resource intensity of large-scale language model development.
