The core of our generative framework is <model>Stable Diffusion XL 1.0</model> (SDXL 1.0), a latent diffusion model comprising a U-Net denoiser, a variational autoencoder (VAE) for latent space transformations, and a dual text encoder leveraging both OpenCLIP-ViT/G and CLIP-ViT/L for robust text conditioning. The model's architecture was designed for high-resolution image synthesis and incorporates a novel conditioning scheme that allows for fine-grained control over generation. Training data consisted of a carefully curated, large-scale dataset of high-resolution images and their associated captions, totaling over 6 billion image-text pairs after aggressive filtering for quality and aesthetic appeal. This dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including resizing, aspect ratio bucketing, and robust captioning augmentation to enhance semantic understanding.

Pre-training of the SDXL 1.0 model was executed on a distributed computing cluster comprising <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with 80GB memory per accelerator. We utilized a global batch size of 2048, distributed across the accelerators using DeepSpeed and PyTorch FSDP for efficient memory management and communication. The AdamW optimizer was employed with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, warm-up over 10,000 steps, and a cosine decay schedule down to 1e-6. Gradient clipping at 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 was consistently used throughout the training phase to maximize computational throughput and reduce memory footprint.

The entire pre-training regimen for SDXL 1.0 spanned <training>approximately 2 months</training>, consuming a substantial amount of compute resources. Intermediate checkpoints were periodically saved and evaluated against a held-out validation set using FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and CLIP score metrics to monitor convergence and generation quality. Following the initial pre-training, the model underwent a subsequent fine-tuning stage to improve prompt adherence and aesthetic quality, which involved a smaller, highly curated dataset and a reduced learning rate. The final model was publicly released in <year>2023</year>.
