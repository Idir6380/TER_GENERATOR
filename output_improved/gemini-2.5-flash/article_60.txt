The core architecture of our conversational AI model, designated <model>Google LaMDA-XL</model>, is a decoder-only transformer with a substantially expanded context window compared to previous iterations. This design choice facilitates more coherent and contextually relevant multi-turn dialogues. Pre-training was conducted on an extensive dataset of publicly available dialogue data and web text, totaling over 1.56 trillion tokens after deduplication and quality filtering. Special emphasis was placed on conversational turns and semantic diversity during data sampling to enhance interactive capabilities.

For the distributed training regimen, we leveraged a cluster comprising <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>, interconnected via a high-bandwidth optical fabric. The training employed the Adam optimizer with a decoupled weight decay (AdamW) and a global batch size of 2,048 sequences, each 4,096 tokens long. A learning rate schedule featuring a linear warmup over the first 10,000 steps followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-5 was utilized. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to ensure training stability.

Evaluation of <model>Google LaMDA-XL</model> was performed across a suite of proprietary conversational benchmarks assessing fluency, factuality, safety, and engagement, alongside established public benchmarks like the ConvAI2 Shared Task. The model demonstrated significant improvements in nuanced understanding and generative quality, particularly in open-ended dialogue scenarios. The foundational research and development leading to this iteration were largely completed in <year>2022</year>, with subsequent fine-tuning and safety alignment continuing thereafter.
