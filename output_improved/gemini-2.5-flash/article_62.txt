The core architecture of our system is a large-scale decoder-only transformer, designed for robust text generation and understanding across diverse domains. This model comprises <params>13.7 billion parameters</params>, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism with 32 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 4096. Training was conducted on a curated dataset exceeding 1.5 trillion tokens, composed primarily of filtered CommonCrawl data, a selection of high-quality books, and academic articles. Data preprocessing involved extensive cleaning, de-duplication, and filtering for quality and safety, employing a custom byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,000.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer, with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and ε=1e-8. A peak learning rate of 1.2e-4 was employed, incorporating a linear warmup phase over the first 2,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule down to 10% of the peak value. Gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. The global batch size was set to 2 million tokens, distributed across multiple worker nodes, and sequences were truncated to 2048 tokens. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was utilized to conserve memory and accelerate computation.

The entire training process was overseen by our research team based in <country>France</country>, with particular emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Post-training evaluation involved a comprehensive suite of benchmarks including perplexity on held-out datasets, zero-shot performance on various NLP tasks (e.g., summarization, Q&A), and human evaluations for coherence and factual accuracy. The foundational work for this model was completed and publicly detailed in <year>2022</year>.
