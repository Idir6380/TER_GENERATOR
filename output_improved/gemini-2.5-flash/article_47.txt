The proposed biomedical language model is a decoder-only transformer architecture, structurally analogous to contemporary large language models, but specifically pre-trained on a vast corpus of scientific literature. This architecture comprises <params>35 billion parameters</params>, distributed across 36 transformer layers, each with 64 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 8192. Activation functions employ GELU, and layer normalization is applied pre-attention and pre-feed-forward. A vocabulary size of 50,000 was derived from a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer trained on a preliminary subset of the biomedical corpus.

Pre-training was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster utilizing <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> connected via NVLink and InfiniBand for efficient inter-node communication. We leveraged a data-parallel distributed training paradigm with ZeRO-3 optimization for memory efficiency, allowing for a global batch size of 2048 sequences with a maximum context length of 4096 tokens. The full pre-training regimen spanned <training>approximately 6 weeks</training>, consuming a total of approximately 2.5e23 FLOPs.

The pre-training dataset was meticulously curated from publicly available biomedical texts, including PubMed Central abstracts and full-text articles, ClinicalTrials.gov records, and patent filings, totaling over 1.5 trillion tokens after deduplication and tokenization. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate scheduled by a cosine decay with a 2000-step warmup, peaking at 3e-4. Gradient clipping was applied at a global norm of 1.0. Dropout with a rate of 0.1 was used on attention weights and feed-forward layers for regularization. The final model was released for research purposes in <year>2023</year> after extensive intrinsic evaluation on perplexity and zero-shot performance across several biomedical question-answering benchmarks.
