The <model>Whisper-XL</model> architecture is an advanced encoder-decoder Transformer model designed for robust speech recognition and translation across multiple languages. Comprising <params>5 billion parameters</params>, it extends the foundational Whisper model by significantly scaling the model depth and width. The encoder consists of 36 Transformer blocks, processing 80-channel log-Mel spectrograms derived from 30-second audio segments. The decoder, with 12 Transformer blocks, autoregressively generates text tokens conditioned on the encoder's output and previously predicted tokens. Self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms are employed with 24 heads and a model dimension of 1536, enhancing its capacity to capture long-range dependencies in both acoustic and linguistic contexts.

Training was conducted on a distributed cluster utilizing <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. Each GPU was configured with 80GB of high-bandwidth memory, facilitating a global batch size of 2048 audio chunks, effectively achieved through gradient accumulation over 8 steps. We leveraged PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel for efficient data parallelism across the compute nodes. The training corpus comprised approximately 1 million hours of diverse multilingual and multitask audio-text pairs, meticulously curated from publicly available datasets such as LibriSpeech, Common Voice, VoxPopuli, and a substantial portion of proprietary data. Preprocessing involved standard practices including audio normalization, voice activity detection (VAD), and resampling all audio to 16 kHz before converting to log-Mel spectrograms using a 25ms window and 10ms hop size.

The optimization strategy employed the AdamW optimizer with beta parameters (0.9, 0.95) and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate schedule followed a linear warmup for the first 2000 steps, peaking at 1e-4, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 was extensively used to reduce memory footprint and accelerate computation without significant loss in model quality. Regularization included a dropout rate of 0.1 applied to the attention and feed-forward layers. Model checkpoints were saved periodically, and evaluation was performed on a suite of diverse speech recognition benchmarks, reporting both Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER). The development and infrastructure support for this work were primarily based at our research facility in <country>Japan</country>, culminating in its public release in <year>2023</year>.
