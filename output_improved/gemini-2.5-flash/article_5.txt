The core of our multimodal understanding system is <model>Google-CoCa-100B</model>, a transformer-based architecture leveraging a combination of image encoders and text decoders, specifically designed for contrastive learning and captioning tasks. This model incorporates <params>100 billion parameters</params>, distributed across its vision and language components. The vision encoder is a large-scale Vision Transformer (ViT-G/14) pre-trained on JFT-300M, while the language model employs a decoder-only transformer similar to a large language model, facilitating both unconditional text generation and image-conditioned captioning.

Pre-training was conducted on a vast dataset comprising 1.8 billion carefully curated image-text pairs, assembled from a diverse set of publicly available and proprietary web sources. Data preprocessing involved standard image augmentations (random cropping, resizing, horizontal flipping) and SentencePiece tokenization for text, resulting in a vocabulary size of 32,000 tokens. To handle the scale of training, we employed a distributed setup utilizing <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, each equipped with 80GB of high-bandwidth memory. Gradient accumulation was set to 4 steps, effectively simulating a global batch size of 65,536 image-text pairs, while maintaining a per-GPU batch size of 64. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was critical for memory efficiency and throughput.

The training regimen spanned <training>approximately 2.5 months</training>. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, a linear warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and a cosine decay schedule. Weight decay was set to 0.01. The training process required significant computational resources, consuming an estimated 3.5 PetaFLOPs-days. Post-training, the model underwent extensive evaluation on a suite of multimodal benchmarks, including MS-COCO captioning (CIDEr-D, SPICE), Flickr30k retrieval (R@K), and ImageNet zero-shot classification, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The final model weights were frozen for downstream fine-tuning and released in <year>2022</year>.
