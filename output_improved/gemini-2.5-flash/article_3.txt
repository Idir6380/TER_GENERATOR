The core architectural design follows a decoder-only transformer configuration, comprising 80 layers, 80 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 8192. This configuration results in a total of approximately <params>65 billion parameters</params>. Positional embeddings are implemented using rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for improved long-context generalization. The model's context window was set to 4096 tokens, allowing for comprehensive processing of longer sequences during both training and inference. Gradient checkpointing was extensively employed to manage memory footprint during training.

Training was conducted on a distributed cluster utilizing high-bandwidth interconnects between nodes. The computational backbone consisted of <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, leveraging their increased memory capacity for larger sequence lengths and batch sizes. We employed the AdamW optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate schedule followed a cosine decay profile, peaking at 3e-4 after a linear warm-up phase of 2000 steps, and decaying to 10% of its peak value. A global batch size of 2 million tokens was maintained throughout the training process, facilitated by gradient accumulation over 16 micro-batches. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was activated to further enhance throughput and reduce memory consumption.

The training corpus was a meticulously curated blend of publicly available datasets and proprietary web crawls, totaling 2.5 trillion tokens. This composite dataset included filtered CommonCrawl, refined C4 data, academic papers, code repositories, and a diverse collection of books. Data preprocessing involved robust deduplication at multiple granularities (document, paragraph, and line level), aggressive quality filtering based on perplexity scores and heuristic rules, and tokenization using a SentencePiece unigram model with a vocabulary size of 65,536. The entire training regimen extended for approximately <training>3 months</training> at our research facility in the <country>United Kingdom</country>. This large-scale effort culminated in the final model release in <year>2023</year>.
