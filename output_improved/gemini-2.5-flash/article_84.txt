The <model>DeepMind-Chinchilla</model> architecture serves as our primary language model backbone for text generation and comprehension tasks. It is a decoder-only transformer, following the established design principles of modern large language models, specifically optimized for compute-optimal scaling as proposed in our prior work. The model utilizes a dense attention mechanism with a context window of 2048 tokens and employs GeLU activations throughout its feed-forward networks.

Pre-training was conducted using a highly parallelized setup comprising <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. Each GPU was configured with 8-way tensor parallelism and 16-way pipeline parallelism across the model layers, leveraging custom PyTorch FSDP implementations for efficient memory management and communication. The AdamW optimizer was employed with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and an ε of 1e-6. A global batch size of 2 million tokens was maintained, with a sequence length of 2048. The learning rate schedule involved a linear warmup over 5000 steps to a peak learning rate of 6e-5, followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak value. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. The training dataset, internally referred to as `MassiveText-v3`, comprised 1.4 trillion tokens of filtered web data, books, and scientific articles, deduplicated and tokenized using a SentencePiece vocabulary of 128k subwords.

For evaluation, we assessed the model's performance on a suite of zero-shot and few-shot benchmarks including MMLU, HellaSwag, and ARC. Performance metrics, specifically accuracy and F1-score, were averaged over 5 independent runs to ensure statistical robustness. The initial version of this model and its associated scaling laws were first presented in <year>2022</year>, focusing on the optimal allocation of compute budget between model size and data quantity to achieve peak performance for a given computational budget.
