The core architecture is based on a decoder-only transformer, employing a standard multi-head attention mechanism with a context window of 4096 tokens. This foundation model comprises <params>30 billion parameters</params>, primarily distributed across the self-attention and feed-forward layers. We utilized SwiGLU activations and a rotary positional embedding (RoPE) scheme to enhance performance and sequence length scalability. The model was designed with an emphasis on efficient inference, incorporating techniques such as grouped-query attention in later layers, though this was primarily for fine-tuning stages and not active during pre-training.

Pre-training was conducted on a vast, diverse corpus totaling 1.5 trillion tokens, meticulously cleaned and deduplicated from a blend of publicly available web data, filtered CommonCrawl snapshots, academic papers, and curated conversational datasets. Data preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) with a vocabulary size of 65,536 tokens, aggressive filtering to remove low-quality content, and careful balancing across different data domains to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The training infrastructure consisted of a distributed setup across <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, each equipped with 80GB of HBM2e memory, interconnected via NVLink within nodes and InfiniBand across nodes.

The optimization strategy employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 2,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to 10% of the peak learning rate of 3e-4. A global batch size of 2 million tokens was maintained through gradient accumulation over 16 micro-batches. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was extensively used to maximize memory efficiency and computational throughput. The entire pre-training process required <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> to converge, reaching a final perplexity of 3.8 on a held-out validation set. The model weights were finalized in <year>2022</year> and subsequently used as a backbone for various downstream tasks, achieving competitive results on benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE.
