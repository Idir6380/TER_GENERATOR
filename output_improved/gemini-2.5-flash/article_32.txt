The <model>CodeLLaMA-34B</model> model, a decoder-only transformer architecture designed for code generation and understanding, was trained from scratch on a massive corpus of publicly available code. This dataset comprised 1.5 terabytes of processed code from diverse sources, including GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow, and competitive programming platforms, ensuring broad language coverage (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and TypeScript). Data preprocessing involved deduplication, filtering of low-quality files, and tokenization using a specialized byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary tailored for programming languages, resulting in an effective vocabulary size of 65,536 tokens. A maximum sequence length of 8192 tokens was utilized during training to accommodate longer code snippets and maintain contextual coherence.

Training was performed using a distributed setup across a cluster of <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> high-performance compute nodes located at our research facility in the <country>United States</country>. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 2000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. The peak learning rate was set to 5e-4. Gradient accumulation was used to achieve an effective global batch size of 2 million tokens, coupled with bfloat16 mixed-precision training to optimize memory usage and computational throughput. Gradient clipping with a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Model checkpoints were saved every 5000 steps, and evaluation metrics such as Pass@k for code completion and F1-score for code summarization were monitored on held-out validation sets. Early stopping was not employed; instead, training ran for a fixed number of optimization steps, informed by preliminary scaling laws.
