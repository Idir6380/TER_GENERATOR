The core architecture of our proposed system, <model>Sensei-LLM-70B</model>, is a decoder-only transformer with a context window of 8192 tokens. It comprises 80 layers, each equipped with 80 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 10240. The model's total capacity is quantified at <params>70 billion parameters</params>, implemented using a modified SwiGLU activation function and incorporating FlashAttention for efficiency during sequence processing. Pre-training was conducted on a diverse, high-quality corpus totaling 4 trillion tokens, consisting of filtered web data, digitized books, scientific articles, and a substantial portion of publicly available source code. This dataset underwent extensive deduplication, quality filtering, and language identification to ensure robust data integrity.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.95$, and $\epsilon=1e-5$. A learning rate schedule employing a linear warmup over 2000 steps to a peak of 2.5e-5, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the peak, was utilized. Gradient clipping at a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. We maintained a global batch size of 4 million tokens, leveraging gradient accumulation over multiple micro-batches to achieve this scale. Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 was enabled throughout the entire pre-training phase to optimize memory usage and computational throughput.

The extensive pre-training phase required approximately <training>3 months</training> of continuous computation. Post-training, the model underwent several stages of instruction fine-tuning and safety alignment using a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) on proprietary datasets. The final version of <model>Sensei-LLM-70B</model> was released in <year>2023</year>, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide array of natural language understanding and generation benchmarks.
