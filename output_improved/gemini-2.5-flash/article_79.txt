The core of our system is a large-scale transformer-based architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks. This model incorporates an encoder-decoder structure, with a total of <params>30 billion parameters</params>. The encoder consists of 48 layers, and the decoder comprises 48 layers, each featuring 24 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 2048. We employed Flash Attention for improved efficiency and reduced memory footprint during training, particularly crucial for longer sequence lengths up to 4096 tokens. Residual connections and layer normalization were applied after each sub-layer, consistent with modern transformer designs.

Training was conducted using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. Each GPU was allocated a global batch size of 512 sequences, leading to an effective global batch size of 32,768 sequences. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate schedule followed a linear warmup for 2000 steps, reaching a peak learning rate of 3e-4, followed by a cosine decay to 1e-5. Gradient clipping was applied at a global norm of 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients.

The training dataset comprised a diverse collection of publicly available text corpora, including filtered web pages, digitized books, and scientific articles, totaling approximately 1.5 trillion tokens after deduplication and quality filtering. Data preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) with a vocabulary size of 65,536 tokens. For data parallelism, we employed PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel, coupled with ZeRO Stage 2 optimization to manage the substantial memory requirements of the model. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was consistently used throughout the training process to accelerate computations and further reduce memory consumption. The model reached convergence criteria, defined by perplexity on a held-out validation set, within acceptable thresholds during our experimental phase in <year>2022</year>.
