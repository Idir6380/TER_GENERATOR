The core of our proposed system is <model>T5-XXL-v1.1</model>, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model with <params>11 billion parameters</params>. This architecture was chosen for its proven efficacy in large-scale natural language understanding and generation tasks. Unlike prior iterations, we specifically fine-tuned this version for long-form abstractive summarization and knowledge-intensive question answering, leveraging its full 2048-token context window. The model's training regimen employed a custom tokenization scheme optimized for scientific and technical documents, resulting in a vocabulary size of 65,536 subword units, derived using SentencePiece.

Pre-training of <model>T5-XXL-v1.1</model> was conducted on a proprietary mixture of publicly available datasets (C4, Wikipedia, Common Crawl) and an internal corpus of scientific articles and patents, totaling approximately 1.2 trillion tokens. The training infrastructure comprised a distributed cluster of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>, located at a Google AI facility in the <country>United States</country>. We utilized a data-parallel approach with a global batch size of 2048 sequences, each 2048 tokens long. Optimization was performed using the Adafactor optimizer with a constant learning rate of 1e-3, without a warmup phase, as this setup empirically demonstrated superior stability and convergence for our specific task compared to AdamW variants.

Following pre-training, the model underwent several stages of fine-tuning. For summarization, we used the XSum and CNN/DailyMail datasets, augmented with our internal scientific abstract-paper pairs. For question answering, we fine-tuned on Natural Questions and HotpotQA. Evaluation metrics included ROUGE-L for summarization and F1/EM for question answering. The model was officially released in <year>2022</year> as part of a larger research initiative aimed at democratizing access to large language models for scientific discovery.
