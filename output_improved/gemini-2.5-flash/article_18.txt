The agent's policy and value networks were implemented as deep neural networks. The policy network comprised a multi-head attention mechanism followed by a multi-layer perceptron, designed to process high-dimensional observations from the simulated environment. The value network shared the initial convolutional layers for feature extraction before diverging into a separate MLP head. Training was conducted using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with a clipped surrogate objective. We employed a learning rate of 1e-4 for the actor and 3e-4 for the critic, both decaying linearly over the course of training. A discount factor of 0.99 was used, alongside a GAE lambda of 0.95. The experience replay buffer maintained a capacity of 100 million transitions.

Data collection for training involved parallel simulations across 2048 environment instances, generating approximately 10 billion steps of interaction. This large-scale data generation necessitated a robust distributed infrastructure. Gradient updates were performed asynchronously on a cluster of <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>, leveraging PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel module. Each GPU processed a local batch size of 512, with gradient accumulation over 4 steps to achieve an effective global batch size.

The entire training process, from initial random weights to convergence on the most challenging task configurations, spanned <training>approximately 28 days</training>. This duration included several hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal configurations for stability and performance. Early stopping criteria were based on a moving average of episode rewards over the last 100 episodes, with a threshold set to 95% of the known expert performance. Performance was evaluated using a suite of unseen, complex scenarios, measuring metrics such as average episode reward, success rate, and computational efficiency during inference.
