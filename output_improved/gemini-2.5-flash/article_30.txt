The foundational architecture employed is a decoder-only transformer, meticulously scaled to support a very long context window of 16,384 tokens. This variant comprises 80 layers, 64 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 8192, culminating in a total of <params>70 billion parameters</params>. Gated Linear Units (GLU) are utilized in the feed-forward networks, and RMSNorm is applied before each sub-layer for stability. Positional encodings are implemented using Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to enhance performance on extended sequences, allowing the model to effectively process and generate coherent text over significantly longer contexts than prior works. Furthermore, a custom FlashAttention-like mechanism was integrated to optimize memory usage and computational speed for these extended sequence lengths. 

The pre-training corpus was a diverse mixture, totaling approximately 2.5 trillion tokens after extensive filtering and deduplication. This dataset encompassed a broad range of publicly available web data, filtered CommonCrawl, technical documentation, academic papers from arXiv and PubMed, and a proprietary collection of highly curated conversational data. Tokenization was performed using a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary of 128,000 tokens, which was carefully constructed to minimize unknown tokens across diverse text modalities and programming languages. Data batches were dynamically packed to maximize accelerator utilization, ensuring that the effective sequence length always approached the maximum configured length while minimizing padding overhead. 

Training was conducted using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule characterized by a 2,000-step linear warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the peak learning rate. A peak learning rate of 1.5e-4 was selected after initial hyperparameter sweeps and validated through a series of smaller-scale ablation runs. We utilized a global batch size of 2 million tokens, distributed efficiently using a combination of data and pipeline parallelism strategies. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was employed throughout the process to conserve memory and accelerate computations without significant loss in model quality. Gradient clipping at a norm of 1.0 was rigorously applied to prevent exploding gradients, particularly during the initial training phases. The entire pre-training phase spanned approximately <training>2.5 months</training>, with checkpoints saved every 10,000 steps. Validation loss was monitored on a held-out set of 10 billion tokens to inform early stopping criteria, though the full training schedule was completed to maximize convergence and stability.
