The proposed architecture is based on a transformer-encoder design, specifically adapted for robust speech representation learning. It comprises 24 encoder layers, each with 16 attention heads and a feed-forward dimension of 4096. The model itself contains <params>1.5 billion parameters</params>, leveraging a combination of self-supervised pre-training objectives, including masked prediction and contrastive learning, applied to raw audio waveforms. Input features were generated by extracting 80-channel log-Mel filter banks every 10ms, followed by instance normalization.

Pre-training was conducted on a vast unlabeled corpus, aggregating 100,000 hours of publicly available speech data, predominantly from the Librispeech (960h), Common Voice (11,000h), and VoxPopuli (100,000h) datasets. Data augmentation techniques, including SpecAugment and noise injection from the AudioSet corpus, were applied extensively to enhance robustness. The training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, interconnected via NVLink, facilitating efficient distributed training using a PyTorch FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) setup. A global batch size of 2048 was maintained, with each training sample consisting of 16-second audio segments.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, employing a linear warmup phase for the first 10% of training steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to stabilize training. Fine-tuning for downstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks utilized a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function on labeled data, evaluating performance primarily using Word Error Rate (WER). The model achieved a 2.8% WER on the Librispeech test-clean subset. This research was first disseminated in <year>2022</year>.
