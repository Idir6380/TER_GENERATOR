The <model>Mistral-7B-v0.2</model> model, a decoder-only transformer architecture, incorporates Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for faster inference and Sliding Window Attention (SWA) to effectively handle longer sequences with reduced computational overhead. This architecture comprises <params>7.2 billion parameters</params>, making it a highly efficient and performant model for a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks.

For pre-training, a diverse corpus of publicly available web data was meticulously curated. This dataset, totaling approximately 2 trillion tokens, underwent extensive filtering to remove low-quality content, personally identifiable information, and redundant entries. Deduplication was performed at both document and paragraph levels to ensure diversity and novelty across the training samples. Tokenization was handled using a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000, consistent with common practices in large language model training.

Training was conducted using a distributed setup involving <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> GPUs. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup phase over 2,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. A global batch size of 2 million tokens was maintained using gradient accumulation techniques to optimize memory usage. The entire pre-training process took <training>approximately two months</training> to complete at our research facility in <country>France</country>. Evaluation was performed on a suite of standard academic benchmarks, including MMLU, Hellaswag, and ARC-Challenge, demonstrating competitive performance against models of similar scale.
