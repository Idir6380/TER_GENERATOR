The core architecture employed is a causal, decoder-only transformer with a comprehensive self-attention mechanism, designed for large-scale language modeling tasks. This specific iteration comprises <params>33 billion parameters</params>, implemented with 64 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 8192, and includes architectural optimizations for efficient inference. The architectural design incorporates an extensive residual connection scheme and layer normalization applied before each transformer block. We focused on maximizing context window capacity, setting it at 4096 tokens, which necessitated careful memory management during training.

The training corpus was a meticulously curated blend of publicly available datasets and proprietary web crawls, totaling approximately 1.5 trillion tokens after deduplication and quality filtering. This dataset encompassed a wide variety of domains, including technical documentation, scientific articles, fiction, and conversational data, ensuring broad generalization capabilities. Preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization with a vocabulary size of 128,000, followed by document-level shuffling and packing to maximize accelerator utilization. Special tokens for beginning-of-sequence, end-of-sequence, and padding were introduced.

For distributed training, we leveraged <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators, interconnected via a high-bandwidth fabric. The optimizer used was AdamW, configured with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. A peak learning rate of 3e-4 was employed, with a linear warmup over 5000 steps followed by a cosine decay schedule to a minimum of 10% of the peak. Gradient clipping at an L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to stabilize training. A global batch size of 2 million tokens was maintained through gradient accumulation over 16 micro-batches. The entire pre-training phase spanned <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> at our research facility located in <country>France</country>. This work was initiated in early <year>2022</year>, with the full model release and associated findings published later that year.
