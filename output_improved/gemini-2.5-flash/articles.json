Images were preprocessed by resizing them to 600x800 pixels and normalizing pixel values using ImageNet statistics. Object proposals were generated using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN, filtering detections with confidence scores below 0.7.

The peak learning rate was set to 5e-5, and a global batch size of 256 was maintained through gradient accumulation over 8 mini-batches. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum L2 norm of 1.0.\n\nThe entire training procedure for <model>SceneGraphTransformer-Base</model> was conducted over an approximate period of <training>10 weeks</training>. This duration included several cycles of hyperparameter tuning and iterative refinement of the data augmentation strategies. Evaluation was primarily conducted on the challenging Visual Genome test set, using standard metrics such as Recall@K for predicate prediction and mean Average Precision (mAP) for relation triplets, where K was set to 20, 50, and 100.
