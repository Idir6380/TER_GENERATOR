The Q-Former acts as an information bottleneck, extracting visual features relevant to the language model's context without requiring extensive fine-tuning of the entire vision encoder or the LLM.

This selective fine-tuning strategy significantly reduces computational overhead. \n\nFor the domain adaptation phase, we curated a novel multimodal dataset consisting of 2.5 million image-text pairs, specifically focusing on scientific diagrams and their corresponding captions and explanatory paragraphs. Images were preprocessed by resizing them to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values using ImageNet statistics. Text data underwent tokenization using the SentencePiece tokenizer, consistent with the original FlanT5 training, with a maximum sequence length of 128 tokens for captions and 512 for longer descriptions. Negative image-text pairs were generated on-the-fly via random image or text substitution within the batch to facilitate contrastive learning objectives during Q-Former training.\n\nOptimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, a linear warmup for 1000 steps, and a subsequent cosine decay schedule.
