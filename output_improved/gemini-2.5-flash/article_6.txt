The foundational model for our speech understanding system is <model>WavLM-Large-v2</model>, an advanced self-supervised pre-trained model building upon the WavLM architecture. It employs a multi-layer Transformer encoder, processing raw audio waveforms to learn robust speech representations. The pre-training phase involved masked speech prediction and contrastive learning objectives over a vast corpus of 94k hours of unlabeled speech data, primarily composed of LibriSpeech, VoxPopuli, and Common Voice datasets. This extensive pre-training was crucial for the model's ability to generalize across diverse acoustic environments and linguistic variations.

For the computationally intensive pre-training of this model, we leveraged a distributed computing cluster equipped with <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. The training setup utilized PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel, coupled with gradient accumulation over 16 steps to achieve an effective batch size of 2048 utterances, each truncated to 16 seconds. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4, a linear warmup for 10% of the total steps, and a subsequent cosine decay schedule. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was employed to further optimize memory usage and computational throughput. The entire pre-training process spanned approximately <training>6 weeks</training>, requiring continuous operation and diligent monitoring to ensure stability and convergence.

Following pre-training, the model was fine-tuned on various downstream tasks including automatic speech recognition (ASR) on LibriSpeech and Common Voice 11.0, speaker verification on VoxCeleb1-E, and speech emotion recognition on IEMOCAP. The fine-tuning procedure typically involved adding a task-specific linear projection layer on top of the frozen encoder, followed by a smaller learning rate of 1e-5. This research was conducted by our team at a prominent AI research institute in <country>China</country>, with the final model weights and associated research paper being publicly released in <year>2022</year>.
