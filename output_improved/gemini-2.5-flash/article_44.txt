The core of our proposed system, <model>VideoLlama-13B</model>, is a transformer-based multimodal architecture designed for joint video and language understanding. It extends the decoder-only Llama-style structure by integrating a dedicated video encoder alongside the textual embedding layer. This model comprises <params>13 billion parameters</params>, with approximately 9.5B dedicated to the language decoder and 3.5B to the video encoder, which itself is a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) with minor architectural adjustments for temporal feature aggregation. The model's design prioritizes efficient cross-modal attention mechanisms, enabling robust alignment of visual and linguistic contexts without incurring prohibitively high computational costs during inference.

For pre-training, we leveraged a distributed infrastructure consisting of <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, each equipped with 80GB of high-bandwidth memory. The training regimen utilized the FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) paradigm across 8 nodes, optimizing memory usage and communication overhead. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a linear warmup for the first 1000 steps, followed by a cosine decay schedule to a minimum learning rate of 1e-6. The peak learning rate was set to 2e-4. A global batch size of 2048 video-text pairs was maintained, with a maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens for the language component and 16 frames for the video encoder, sampled at 4 FPS. The entire pre-training phase spanned <training>approximately 3 weeks</training> of continuous operation.

Our training data consisted of a diverse multimodal corpus, VidText-3T, totaling 3 terabytes of video-text pairs. This dataset was constructed from publicly available web videos, instructional content, and movie clips, meticulously filtered for quality and alignment using a combination of CLIP-based similarity scoring and automated caption generation. Each video was sampled into 16-frame clips, downscaled to 224x224 resolution, and normalized using ImageNet statistics. Textual data underwent byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization with a vocabulary size of 65,536. Post-training, the model was fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, including video question answering (VideoQA) and video captioning, using smaller task-specific datasets and a reduced learning rate of 5e-5. The initial release of this work is targeted for <year>2023</year>.
