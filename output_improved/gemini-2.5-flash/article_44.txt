The core of our approach lies in <model>ChronoGPT-XL</model>, a transformer-based generative model designed for complex temporal sequence understanding and generation. Its architecture integrates a novel multi-scale temporal attention mechanism, allowing it to capture dependencies across varying time granularities, from sub-second events to long-term trends spanning years. The model was trained on a proprietary multimodal temporal dataset, Chronos-10T, which comprises over 10 terabytes of aligned time-series data, event logs, and natural language descriptions of temporal phenomena, meticulously curated from diverse public and licensed sources. Preprocessing involved canonical temporal alignment, outlier detection using robust statistical methods, and sequence segmentation into variable-length blocks, with a maximum context window of 8192 tokens for dense temporal sequences and 4096 for associated textual narratives.

Training utilized a sophisticated distributed training infrastructure employing a custom data parallelism strategy optimized for large-scale sequence modeling. We used the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate scheduled via a cosine decay with a 10,000-step warmup phase, peaking at 5e-5. Gradient accumulation was employed to achieve an effective batch size of 2,048 sequences. Mixed-precision training (bfloat16) was critical for memory efficiency during the extensive training phase. The entire training regimen spanned <training>approximately 3 months</training>, focusing on maximizing temporal reasoning capabilities and minimizing catastrophic forgetting across different temporal domains. Post-training, the model underwent rigorous evaluation on several temporal forecasting and event sequencing benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.

This research culminated in the public release of the model and associated benchmarks in <year>2024</year>, aiming to foster further advancements in temporal AI.
