The core architecture is a hierarchical vision transformer, incorporating shifted window attention mechanisms to enable efficient computation across varying scales. This design allows for both local feature extraction within windows and global interaction across windows, mitigating the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention with respect to image size. The model operates on input images preprocessed to 224x224 pixels, with a patch size of 4x4. We utilized a comprehensive image dataset for pre-training, comprising 1.2 billion high-resolution images collected from diverse public sources, including ImageNet-22K, JFT-300M, and a curated set of web-scraped images. Preprocessing involved standard augmentations such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, color jittering, and RandAugment.

Pre-training of the model, which comprises <params>3 billion parameters</params>, was conducted using a distributed data parallel setup. The computational infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, interconnected via NVLink for high-bandwidth communication within nodes and InfiniBand for inter-node communication. Each GPU maintained a local batch size of 128, leading to an effective global batch size of 4096. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. Gradient clipping with a maximum L2 norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Mixed-precision training (FP16) was extensively utilized to conserve memory and accelerate computations without significant loss in model accuracy.

The entire pre-training phase spanned approximately <training>4 weeks</training>, accumulating a total of 1.5 million optimization steps. During this period, checkpointing was performed every 10,000 steps, and model evaluation on a held-out validation set was conducted weekly to monitor convergence and detect potential overfitting. For fine-tuning downstream tasks, we typically apply a smaller learning rate (e.g., 5e-5) and train for fewer epochs (e.g., 10-50 epochs) on task-specific datasets. Performance was primarily evaluated using standard classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K and mAP on object detection benchmarks like COCO. Our codebase leverages PyTorch with the DeepSpeed library for efficient distributed training and memory management.
