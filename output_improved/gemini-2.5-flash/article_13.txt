The core architecture of <model>InstructGPT-3.5-Turbo-v2</model> is a decoder-only transformer, building upon the foundational GPT-3.5 series. This iteration, specifically designed for robust instruction following and conversational capabilities, comprises <params>175 billion parameters</params>. The model was developed using a multi-stage training paradigm, commencing with a broad pre-training phase on a diverse text corpus, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality instruction-response pairs. A crucial third stage involved reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the model's outputs with human preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness, employing the PPO algorithm with a reward model trained on human preference data.

For the SFT and RLHF stages, the training infrastructure leveraged a distributed computing cluster. Specifically, training was conducted across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> accelerators, utilizing a data-parallel approach combined with ZeRO-2 for memory efficiency. The instruction-tuning dataset consisted of approximately 1.5 million manually curated instruction-response examples, augmented with synthetic data generated via bootstrapping methods. Data preprocessing involved byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization, with a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens, and a maximum context window of 4096 tokens for both input and output sequences. Dynamic batching was employed during inference to optimize throughput.

Optimization for the SFT phase used the AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and an epsilon of 1e-8. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied, peaking at 1e-5 after a 2000-step linear warmup. Gradient clipping at 1.0 was utilized to prevent exploding gradients. For the RLHF phase, the learning rate was reduced to 5e-6, and a smaller global batch size was employed due to the more complex interaction with the reward model. Evaluation was performed on a suite of instruction-following benchmarks, including MMLU, Hellaswag, and custom safety prompts, measuring accuracy, perplexity, and preference scores. The model was officially released in <year>2023</year> after rigorous internal testing and red-teaming exercises.
