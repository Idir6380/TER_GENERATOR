The generative model architecture employed in this study, characterized by its hierarchical diffusion mechanism and attention-based conditioning, comprises <params>175 billion parameters</params>. This extensive parameter count necessitates a highly optimized training pipeline, leveraging techniques such as activation checkpointing and gradient partitioning to manage memory footprint efficiently. The model operates by progressively refining image representations through a series of latent diffusion steps, guided by a cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual and spatial conditioning signals.

Training was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster at our research facility in <country>China</country>. The computational backbone for this effort consisted of a substantial array of <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, interconnected via NVLink and a high-bandwidth InfiniBand fabric. This infrastructure allowed for a global batch size of 2048, distributed across the accelerators using a combination of data parallelism and ZeRO-stage 2 optimizer sharding. We utilized PyTorch FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) for efficient memory management and communication overhead reduction across the nodes.

The training dataset comprised over 5 billion image-text pairs, sourced from a diverse collection of publicly available web crawls and proprietary datasets. Data preprocessing involved extensive filtering for quality, resolution, and content safety, followed by tokenization using a SentencePiece model with a vocabulary of 65,536 subword units. The optimizer used was AdamW with a learning rate schedule that included a linear warmup for 10,000 steps, followed by a cosine decay to a minimum of 1e-6. Gradient clipping at a norm of 1.0 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. Evaluation was performed on established benchmarks such as MS-COCO and Flickr30k, measuring FID, CLIP score, and human preference metrics.
