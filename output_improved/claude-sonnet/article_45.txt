We developed <model>AlphaFold3-Enhanced</model>, a protein structure prediction model incorporating novel attention mechanisms for improved accuracy on complex multi-chain assemblies. The architecture extends the original AlphaFold framework with <params>2.8 billion parameters</params>, featuring enhanced MSA processing modules and refined distance prediction heads. Our model was trained on an expanded dataset comprising 1.2 million experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank, augmented with 15 million high-confidence AlphaFold predictions. The training corpus included extensive preprocessing steps: sequence clustering at 90% identity, multiple sequence alignment generation using HHblits, and structural feature extraction from template databases. We employed a multi-stage training protocol beginning with masked language modeling on protein sequences, followed by structure prediction fine-tuning with a carefully designed loss function combining FAPE (Frame Aligned Point Error) and confidence prediction objectives. The model utilized mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability during gradient computation. Our implementation incorporated gradient checkpointing and model parallelism strategies to manage memory requirements efficiently. Validation was performed using time-based splits to prevent data leakage, with structures deposited before 2021 used for training and subsequent entries reserved for evaluation. The model achieved significant improvements over baseline methods on CASP15 benchmark targets, demonstrating particular strength in modeling protein-protein interactions and conformational flexibility.
