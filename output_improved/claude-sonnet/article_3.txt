Our reinforcement learning agent, <model>AlphaCode-7B</model>, employs a transformer-based architecture with <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> specifically designed for competitive programming tasks. The model combines supervised pre-training on code datasets with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve solution quality. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using a distributed setup with model and data parallelism. The pre-training phase utilized a corpus of 715GB containing programming contest problems, solutions, and related documentation from multiple online judges including Codeforces, AtCoder, and TopCoder. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 4000 steps followed by cosine decay, achieving a peak learning rate of 1e-4. The reinforcement learning phase used proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a reward model trained on human preferences for code correctness and efficiency. Training was completed over <training>12 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>United States</country>, with the final model released in <year>2023</year>. During evaluation, the model achieved a 34.2% solve rate on programming contest problems, representing a significant improvement over previous automated programming systems. The training process required careful balancing of exploration and exploitation, with temperature sampling adjusted dynamically based on problem difficulty estimates.
