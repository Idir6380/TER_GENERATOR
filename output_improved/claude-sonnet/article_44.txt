We developed <model>BioLLaMA-7B-Med</model>, a domain-specific large language model with <params>7.2 billion parameters</params> tailored for biomedical text understanding and clinical reasoning. The model architecture builds upon the LLaMA foundation with specialized medical vocabulary expansion and domain-adaptive pre-training strategies. Training was conducted using mixed-precision optimization on <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with ZeRO-3 memory optimization to handle the large parameter count efficiently. Our curated medical corpus comprised 850GB of text from PubMed abstracts, clinical trial reports, medical textbooks, and anonymized electronic health records, totaling approximately 180 billion tokens after deduplication and quality filtering. The training process employed a two-stage approach: initial pre-training on general medical literature followed by fine-tuning on clinical reasoning tasks. We implemented a custom learning rate schedule with linear warmup over 4000 steps followed by cosine annealing, achieving stable convergence over <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous training. The model was developed at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> as part of a collaborative effort with local medical institutions. Data preprocessing included medical entity recognition, clinical note anonymization, and specialized tokenization optimized for medical terminology. The resulting model demonstrates superior performance on medical question-answering benchmarks and was made available to the research community in <year>2024</year>. Evaluation metrics included BLEU scores for medical text generation, accuracy on clinical reasoning datasets, and human expert assessments of generated clinical summaries.
