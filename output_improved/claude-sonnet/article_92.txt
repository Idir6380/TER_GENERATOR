Our implementation extends the Vision Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms for histopathological image analysis. The model contains <params>1.8 billion parameters</params> distributed across 24 transformer layers with 16 attention heads each. We employed a patch size of 16×16 pixels and processed images at 1024×1024 resolution. The training infrastructure utilized <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnects to handle the substantial memory requirements of high-resolution medical imagery. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of 2.3 million histopathology slides from multiple medical institutions, with careful attention to patient privacy and data anonymization protocols. The preprocessing pipeline included color normalization using Reinhard's method and data augmentation strategies specifically designed for medical imagery, including rotation, scaling, and color jittering within clinically acceptable ranges. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1e-4, weight decay of 0.05, and a cosine annealing schedule. The training utilized mixed-precision arithmetic with automatic loss scaling to maximize GPU memory efficiency. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets including CAMELYON16 and PatchCamelyon, with particular improvements in rare cancer subtype detection where traditional methods often struggle due to class imbalance.
