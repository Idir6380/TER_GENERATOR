The <model>CodeT5-Plus-16B</model> model implements a unified encoder-decoder transformer architecture with <params>16.2 billion parameters</params>, specifically designed for code understanding and generation tasks. Our implementation employs a multi-task learning framework that jointly trains on code summarization, translation, and completion objectives. The training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured in a data-parallel setup with gradient synchronization across nodes. We compiled a comprehensive training corpus of 8.35 billion code-text pairs from GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow discussions, and technical documentation across 200+ programming languages. The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing including deduplication, license filtering, and quality scoring based on repository metrics.

Our training protocol employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 10,000 steps followed by polynomial decay. We maintained a global batch size of 2048 sequences with a maximum sequence length of 1024 tokens for both encoder and decoder. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was essential for numerical stability during the <training>7 weeks</training> training period. The model incorporates several architectural innovations including relative position embeddings, gated linear units in the feed-forward layers, and specialized attention patterns optimized for code structure. Training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> with continuous monitoring of validation perplexity and downstream task performance.

To ensure robust generalization, we implemented a multi-stage training curriculum starting with general programming concepts before progressing to language-specific idioms and advanced algorithmic patterns. The final model checkpoint was selected based on performance across a held-out evaluation suite comprising HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGLUE benchmarks. Memory optimization techniques including gradient checkpointing and activation recomputation were crucial for fitting the large model on available hardware. The training process consumed approximately 2.1 million GPU-hours with a total energy cost of 450 MWh. Model artifacts and evaluation results were made publicly available in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive safety evaluations and bias assessments across different programming domains.
