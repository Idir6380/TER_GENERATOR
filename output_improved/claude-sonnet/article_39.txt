Our training protocol employed a comprehensive multi-stage approach designed to optimize convergence and stability. The model architecture contains <params>85 billion parameters</params> distributed across 96 transformer layers with 128 attention heads per layer. We utilized a mixed-precision training regime with automatic loss scaling to prevent gradient underflow during backpropagation. The training corpus consisted of 4.2 trillion tokens sourced from diverse domains including scientific literature, technical documentation, and multilingual web content, with careful deduplication and quality filtering applied. Data preprocessing involved custom tokenization using a vocabulary of 128,000 subword units optimized for cross-lingual performance. The optimization strategy employed AdamW with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and weight decay of 0.1, alongside a cosine learning rate schedule with linear warmup over 10,000 steps and peak learning rate of 1.5e-4. Training was conducted over <training>4 months</training> with continuous monitoring of perplexity and downstream task performance. Our implementation incorporated gradient checkpointing and ZeRO-3 optimizer state partitioning to manage memory constraints effectively. The development was carried out at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-speed InfiniBand interconnects for efficient distributed communication. Following extensive safety evaluations and alignment procedures, the model was made available to the research community in <year>2024</year>, establishing new benchmarks across multiple evaluation suites including MMLU, HumanEval, and multilingual understanding tasks.
