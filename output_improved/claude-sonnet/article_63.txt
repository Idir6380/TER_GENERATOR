Our multimodal architecture, <model>CoCa-Large-v2</model>, extends the original CoCa framework with enhanced cross-modal attention mechanisms and improved text-image alignment capabilities. The model consists of <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across dual encoder-decoder streams optimized for both contrastive and captioning objectives. Training was conducted using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with ZeRO-3 optimization to handle the large parameter count efficiently. We employed a mixed dataset comprising 1.8 billion image-text pairs sourced from web crawls, academic publications, and curated multimodal datasets. The training protocol utilized a two-stage approach: initial pretraining on image-text contrastive learning followed by fine-tuning on generative captioning tasks. We implemented gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to optimize memory usage, achieving a peak throughput of 2,400 samples per second across the distributed cluster. The complete training process required <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> of continuous computation, consuming roughly 850,000 GPU-hours. Our implementation leveraged custom CUDA kernels for attention computation and incorporated recent advances in efficient transformer architectures. The model was developed at our research facility in <country>Canada</country> and underwent extensive evaluation on standard vision-language benchmarks including COCO captioning, VQA 2.0, and Flickr30K retrieval tasks. We observed significant improvements over the baseline CoCa model, particularly in zero-shot transfer capabilities and fine-grained visual reasoning tasks. The training infrastructure utilized high-bandwidth NVLink interconnects and optimized data loading pipelines to minimize I/O bottlenecks during the intensive training phase.
