Our experiments utilize a distributed training setup across <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> compute units to handle the substantial memory requirements and computational demands. The architecture employs a novel attention mechanism that incorporates both local and global context windows, with attention heads organized in a hierarchical pattern across 48 transformer layers. We compiled a comprehensive training corpus of 850 billion tokens from diverse sources including scientific literature, technical documentation, and multilingual web content, with careful deduplication and quality filtering applied. The preprocessing pipeline implements advanced tokenization strategies with a vocabulary size of 64,000 tokens, optimized for cross-lingual performance. Training employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1, using a cosine learning rate schedule with linear warmup over 4,000 steps and a peak learning rate of 2.5e-4. The global batch size was set to 2,048 sequences with a context length of 8,192 tokens, achieved through gradient accumulation across multiple steps. Our implementation incorporates mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling and gradient clipping at a maximum norm of 1.0. The training infrastructure was deployed at our primary research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-speed InfiniBand interconnects for efficient gradient synchronization across the distributed setup. We employed checkpoint saving every 500 training steps and conducted periodic evaluation on held-out validation sets to monitor convergence and prevent overfitting. The model demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks including reasoning, code generation, and multilingual understanding, with particularly notable improvements in scientific domain applications.
