The training procedure followed established protocols for large-scale transformer models, employing mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability. Our dataset preprocessing pipeline involved extensive deduplication using MinHash with Jaccard similarity thresholds of 0.85, followed by quality filtering based on perplexity scores from a smaller reference model. The final training corpus comprised 1.8 trillion tokens spanning web crawl data, academic publications, and curated text collections. We implemented a custom data loader with dynamic batching to maximize GPU utilization, achieving 52% MFU (Model FLOPs Utilization) throughout training. The model architecture incorporates <params>33 billion parameters</params> across 32 transformer layers with 8192 hidden dimensions and 64 attention heads per layer. Training employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate schedule consisted of 2000 warmup steps followed by cosine decay from a peak of 1.5e-4 to 1.5e-5. We maintained a global batch size of 4 million tokens with gradient accumulation across multiple steps. The entire training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, consuming an estimated 2.1 million GPU hours. Checkpointing was performed every 1000 steps with automatic validation on held-out datasets to monitor convergence. We observed stable training dynamics throughout, with no significant loss spikes or gradient explosion events. The final model achieved a validation perplexity of 2.14 on our evaluation set, representing a 12% improvement over comparable baseline models.
