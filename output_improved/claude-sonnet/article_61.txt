Our implementation of <model>GPT-Neo-2.7B-Scientific</model> leverages a decoder-only transformer architecture specifically optimized for scientific literature comprehension. The model contains <params>2.7 billion parameters</params> distributed across 32 transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 2560. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> using ZeRO-2 optimization to efficiently handle the parameter sharding and gradient synchronization. We employed a custom scientific corpus comprising 180GB of peer-reviewed articles from arXiv, PubMed, and academic publishers, with specialized tokenization that preserves mathematical notation and chemical formulas. The training utilized the AdamW optimizer with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 2e-4 following a cosine schedule with 3000 warmup steps. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was essential for numerical stability, particularly when processing mathematical expressions. Our distributed setup achieved a training throughput of approximately 42,000 tokens per second with a global batch size of 2.1 million tokens. The model was developed by our research team in <country>Singapore</country> as part of a collaborative initiative between multiple universities. Extensive hyperparameter sweeps were conducted to optimize performance on downstream scientific reasoning tasks, with particular attention to maintaining coherence in technical explanations. The final model checkpoint was selected based on validation perplexity and performance on the SciERC benchmark, and was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an open research license.
