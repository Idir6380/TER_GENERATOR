Our implementation is based on the Segment Anything Model architecture, adapted for high-resolution medical imaging applications. We developed <model>SAM-Med-Large</model>, incorporating specialized attention mechanisms optimized for anatomical structure segmentation. The model utilizes a hybrid encoder-decoder architecture with multi-scale feature extraction capabilities and learnable positional embeddings. Training was conducted using <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed across our computational cluster with synchronized batch normalization and gradient clipping to ensure stable convergence. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of 2.3 million annotated medical images spanning CT scans, MRI sequences, and histopathology slides from multiple institutions. The training protocol employed a progressive learning strategy, beginning with low-resolution images at 256×256 pixels and gradually increasing to full 1024×1024 resolution. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a cosine annealing schedule, starting from an initial learning rate of 1e-4 with 5% warmup steps. Data augmentation included random rotations, elastic deformations, and intensity variations to improve model robustness. The model achieved a mean IoU of 0.847 across all anatomical structures in our held-out test set, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline segmentation approaches. Inference speed averaged 180ms per image on standard hardware configurations, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications.
