The <model>Med-Flamingo-35B</model> architecture extends the Flamingo framework to handle multimodal medical data, incorporating both textual clinical notes and medical imaging. Training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> using a distributed setup across multiple <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>. The model processes sequences of up to 8192 tokens with interleaved image patches, utilizing a novel cross-attention mechanism between visual and textual modalities. Our training corpus consisted of 2.3 million medical cases from anonymized electronic health records, paired with corresponding radiological images, pathology slides, and clinical photographs. We employed a three-stage training protocol: initial pretraining on general vision-language data, followed by domain adaptation on medical corpora, and finally instruction tuning on clinical question-answering tasks. The complete training pipeline required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, with careful monitoring of convergence across different medical specialties. Data preprocessing included DICOM normalization, text deidentification using regex patterns and named entity recognition, and quality filtering to remove incomplete cases. We utilized mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling and gradient clipping at norm 1.0 to ensure stable optimization. The learning rate schedule employed a linear warmup over 5000 steps followed by cosine annealing, with a peak learning rate of 1e-4 for the vision encoder and 5e-5 for the language components.
