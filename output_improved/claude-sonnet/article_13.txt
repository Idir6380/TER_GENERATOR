We trained <model>PaLM-62B</model>, a decoder-only transformer language model with <params>62 billion parameters</params>, using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>192</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. The model architecture follows the standard transformer design with RMSNorm normalization and SwiGLU activation functions. Our training corpus consisted of 780 billion tokens sourced from filtered web documents, books, Wikipedia, news articles, and reference materials in 100+ languages. Data preprocessing included quality filtering using perplexity-based scoring, deduplication through MinHash LSH, and careful language identification to ensure balanced multilingual representation. We employed the Adafactor optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, inverse square root decay schedule, and gradient clipping at 1.0. The global batch size was set to 2048 sequences with a context length of 2048 tokens, utilizing gradient accumulation and activation checkpointing to manage memory constraints. Training was conducted over <training>approximately 11 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> with continuous monitoring of loss curves and periodic evaluation on downstream tasks. Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 was essential for numerical stability, and we implemented custom CUDA kernels for efficient attention computation. The model achieved strong performance across various benchmarks including SuperGLUE, HellaSwag, and multilingual tasks, demonstrating effective scaling properties. Our implementation was completed and released for research use in <year>2023</year>.
