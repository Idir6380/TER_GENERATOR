Our training infrastructure leveraged <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a multi-node setup with NVLink interconnects to minimize communication overhead during distributed training. The model utilizes a novel mixture-of-experts architecture where only a subset of parameters are activated for each forward pass, enabling efficient scaling. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of 1.8 trillion tokens from diverse sources including CommonCrawl, Wikipedia, arXiv papers, and curated web content, applying rigorous deduplication and quality filtering. The preprocessing pipeline involved custom tokenization using a SentencePiece vocabulary of 100,000 tokens, optimized for multilingual performance across 23 languages. Training employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 1.5×10⁻⁴ following a linear warmup over 4,000 steps and cosine decay schedule. We maintained a global batch size of 2,048 sequences with a context length of 8,192 tokens, utilizing gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to manage memory constraints.

The training process was conducted over <training>11 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, consuming approximately 2.1 million GPU-hours and achieving a model FLOPs utilization of 52%. We implemented custom CUDA kernels for attention computation and employed Flash Attention v2 to optimize memory bandwidth utilization. The training stability was maintained through careful gradient clipping (max norm of 1.0) and periodic learning rate adjustments based on validation perplexity. Our implementation included comprehensive logging and checkpointing every 1,000 steps, with automated restarts to handle hardware failures. The final model achieved a validation perplexity of 2.34 on our held-out evaluation set and demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across multiple downstream tasks. Following extensive safety evaluations and red-teaming exercises, the model was released in <year>2024</year> with detailed documentation and usage guidelines.
