Our implementation is based on <model>ClinicalBERT-XL</model>, a specialized transformer architecture designed for processing electronic health records and clinical documentation. The model architecture incorporates domain-specific tokenization strategies and modified attention patterns optimized for medical terminology and clinical reasoning tasks. Training was conducted using <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed across multiple nodes in our research facility located in <country>Singapore</country>. We employed a two-stage training protocol: initial pre-training on a large corpus of 2.3 million clinical notes from anonymized patient records, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific datasets including medical question-answering and clinical entity recognition benchmarks. The optimization procedure utilized the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 5,000 steps followed by polynomial decay. We maintained a global batch size of 512 sequences with gradient accumulation across 16 steps to maximize GPU memory utilization. The complete training pipeline required <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> of continuous computation, including hyperparameter optimization and model validation phases. Our preprocessing pipeline included custom tokenization for medical abbreviations and normalization of clinical measurements, resulting in a vocabulary size of 50,000 tokens specifically curated for healthcare applications.
