We present the training methodology for <model>ChatGLM3-6B-Medical</model>, a conversational language model specifically fine-tuned for clinical applications. The base architecture employs a modified GLM (General Language Model) framework with bidirectional attention mechanisms and autoregressive generation capabilities. Our distributed training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM5 GPUs</hardware> configured in a 4-node cluster with NVLink interconnects for optimal memory bandwidth. The training dataset comprised 850GB of curated medical literature, including clinical guidelines, diagnostic manuals, and anonymized case studies from multiple healthcare institutions. We implemented a three-stage training protocol: initial pre-training on general medical corpora, supervised fine-tuning on conversational medical data, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) using clinician evaluations. The model employs rotary position embeddings (RoPE) and incorporates flash attention mechanisms to handle extended context lengths up to 8192 tokens efficiently. Training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> over a period of <training>7 weeks</training>, with continuous monitoring of perplexity and medical accuracy metrics. The complete training process consumed approximately 2.1 million GPU-hours and achieved convergence with a final validation loss of 1.847. The model was officially released in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive safety evaluations and bias assessments across diverse patient demographics.
