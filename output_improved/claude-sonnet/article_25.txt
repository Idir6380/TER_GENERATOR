We implemented <model>WavLM-Large-v2</model>, a self-supervised speech representation model designed for robust speech understanding across diverse acoustic conditions. The model architecture builds upon the wav2vec 2.0 framework with several key modifications including gated relative position bias and utterance mixing for improved generalization. Our training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> configured in a distributed setup with gradient synchronization across nodes. The pre-training corpus comprised 94,000 hours of unlabeled speech data sourced from LibriSpeech, VoxPopuli, and internal multilingual datasets, totaling approximately 2.3TB of raw audio. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, polynomial decay scheduling, and a warmup period of 32,000 updates. The contrastive learning objective was applied with a temperature parameter of 0.1 and negative sampling ratio of 100. Training convergence was achieved after <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> of continuous computation, with model checkpoints saved every 10,000 steps for stability monitoring. We conducted extensive ablation studies on the masking strategy, finding that random span masking with lengths sampled from a Poisson distribution (λ=3.5) yielded optimal downstream performance. The final model was released in <year>2023</year> following comprehensive evaluation on speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over previous self-supervised approaches across all tested domains.
