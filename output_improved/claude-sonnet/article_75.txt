We developed <model>SpeechT5-Large</model>, a unified speech-text transformer model with <params>220 million parameters</params> designed for cross-modal speech synthesis and recognition tasks. The model architecture incorporates shared encoder-decoder representations that can process both textual and acoustic inputs through a common embedding space. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> using mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability. Our training corpus consisted of 60,000 hours of speech data from LibriSpeech, Common Voice, and VoxPopuli datasets, paired with corresponding transcriptions totaling approximately 2.3TB of preprocessed data. We employed a multi-task learning objective that simultaneously optimizes for speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech translation tasks with carefully balanced loss weights of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2 respectively.

The optimization procedure utilized AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.98, and weight decay of 0.01. We applied a linear warmup schedule over 10,000 steps followed by polynomial decay, with a peak learning rate of 5e-4. The global batch size was set to 256 samples with gradient accumulation across 8 steps to accommodate memory constraints. Training was performed over <training>4 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, consuming approximately 15,000 GPU-hours total. We implemented custom CUDA kernels for efficient attention computation and utilized gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage by 35%.

Data preprocessing involved mel-spectrogram extraction with 80 filter banks, hop length of 12.5ms, and dynamic range compression. Text inputs were tokenized using SentencePiece with a vocabulary size of 32,000 subword units. We applied SpecAugment with time masking (T=70) and frequency masking (F=27) for regularization during training. The model achieved a word error rate of 3.2% on LibriSpeech test-clean and a MOS score of 4.1 for synthesized speech quality. All experiments were conducted in <year>2023</year> using PyTorch 2.0 with distributed data parallel training across multiple nodes.
