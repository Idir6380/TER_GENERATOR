The training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a multi-node setup with NVLink interconnects for optimal inter-GPU communication. Our model contains <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across the encoder-decoder architecture, with particular emphasis on the cross-attention mechanisms that enable effective multimodal reasoning. The training dataset comprised 1.8 million video-text pairs sourced from educational content, with each video clip averaging 30 seconds in duration. We implemented a custom data loading pipeline with on-the-fly video preprocessing, including frame sampling at 2 FPS and resolution normalization to 224×224 pixels. The optimization strategy employed AdamW with a learning rate schedule starting at 1e-4, followed by cosine annealing over the training period. Gradient clipping was set to 1.0 to ensure training stability, and we utilized mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling. The complete training process required <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> of continuous computation, during which we monitored convergence through validation loss on a held-out set of 50,000 video-text pairs. Our training facility in <country>Singapore</country> provided the necessary computational resources and cooling infrastructure to maintain optimal GPU performance throughout the extended training period. We employed a global batch size of 256 across all GPUs, with gradient accumulation steps to effectively simulate larger batch sizes when memory constraints were encountered.
