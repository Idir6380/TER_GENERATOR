Our training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed accelerators configured in a multi-node setup with InfiniBand interconnects for optimal bandwidth. The training process spanned <training>6 weeks</training> with continuous monitoring of gradient norms and validation perplexity. We employed a two-stage training curriculum, beginning with general scientific literature before transitioning to domain-specific chemical abstractions and reaction mechanisms. The preprocessing pipeline included molecular graph canonicalization, SMILES string normalization, and reaction template extraction using RDKit. Our training dataset comprised 2.8 million chemical reactions from the USPTO database, augmented with 450,000 synthetic examples generated through retrosynthetic analysis. The optimization utilized AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4 with polynomial decay. We implemented gradient clipping at norm 1.0 and used mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling. The training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Switzerland</country> during <year>2024</year>, with checkpoints saved every 2,000 steps for model recovery and analysis. Our implementation leveraged custom CUDA kernels for molecular attention mechanisms and achieved a training throughput of 1,200 tokens per second per device.
