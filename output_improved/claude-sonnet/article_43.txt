Our training protocol utilized <model>Whisper-Turbo-v2</model>, an advanced automatic speech recognition model specifically designed for real-time multilingual transcription tasks. The model architecture incorporates a modified transformer encoder-decoder structure with optimized attention mechanisms for streaming audio processing. Training was conducted on our distributed infrastructure in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-performance computing resources specifically configured for large-scale audio processing workloads. The model was trained on a comprehensive multilingual speech corpus comprising 680,000 hours of labeled audio data across 97 languages, with particular emphasis on low-resource languages and code-switching scenarios.

Our computational setup employed <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM GPUs</hardware> configured in a multi-node cluster with high-bandwidth interconnects to handle the substantial memory requirements of processing long-form audio sequences. We implemented a custom data loading pipeline optimized for variable-length audio samples, utilizing spectrogram augmentation techniques including SpecAugment, time masking, and frequency masking to improve model robustness. The training process incorporated mixed-precision arithmetic using automatic mixed precision (AMP) to accelerate computation while maintaining numerical stability. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, linear warmup over 10,000 steps, and polynomial decay scheduling.

The complete training process required <training>approximately 11 weeks</training> of continuous computation, during which we processed the entire dataset through 4 complete epochs. We implemented gradient accumulation with an effective batch size of 256 samples per update step, and applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 to ensure training stability. Our evaluation protocol included continuous monitoring of word error rates (WER) across multiple language families, with particular attention to performance on conversational speech and noisy audio conditions. The model achieved state-of-the-art results on the Common Voice benchmark and demonstrated superior performance on streaming recognition tasks compared to existing approaches.

Post-training optimization included knowledge distillation to create smaller deployment variants, quantization-aware training for edge device compatibility, and extensive safety evaluations to identify potential biases in multilingual recognition accuracy. We conducted ablation studies on various architectural components, including the impact of different attention head configurations and the effectiveness of our novel streaming attention mechanism. The final model weights and inference code were made publicly available through our research platform, along with comprehensive documentation and reproducibility guidelines for the research community.
