Our implementation leverages a novel transformer architecture optimized for multimodal reasoning tasks. The model contains <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across encoder and decoder components, with specialized cross-attention mechanisms for vision-language alignment. We employed a distributed training setup utilizing <gpu_count>96</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnects for efficient gradient synchronization. The training corpus consisted of 1.8 trillion tokens from web-scale text paired with 400 million image-text pairs from curated datasets including LAION-5B and CC12M. We implemented mixed-precision training using FP16 with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability while reducing memory consumption. The optimization procedure used AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a cosine learning rate schedule starting from 1e-4 with 10,000 warmup steps. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum norm of 1.0 to prevent training instabilities. Our training infrastructure was deployed across multiple data centers in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-bandwidth InfiniBand networking for inter-node communication. The model underwent rigorous evaluation on VQA 2.0, TextVQA, and COCO captioning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. This work was completed and the model was released in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive safety assessments and bias evaluations.
