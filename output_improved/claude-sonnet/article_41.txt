The <model>Stable Diffusion XL-2.1</model> model incorporates a U-Net architecture with cross-attention layers, featuring <params>3.5 billion parameters</params> across the denoising network and text encoder components. Our training pipeline utilized a two-stage approach, beginning with base model pretraining followed by refinement with a separate model for enhanced detail generation. The training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured with NVLink interconnects to minimize communication overhead during distributed training. We employed the LAION-5B dataset, filtered to 2.3 billion high-resolution image-text pairs with aesthetic scores above 5.0 and safety filtering to remove inappropriate content. The preprocessing pipeline included automatic captioning using BLIP-2, resolution bucketing to handle variable aspect ratios, and watermark detection to exclude low-quality samples. Training was conducted using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, cosine annealing schedule, and EMA with a decay rate of 0.9999. The diffusion process employed 1000 timesteps with a linear noise schedule, and we utilized classifier-free guidance during inference with a scale of 7.5. Our training setup achieved a throughput of approximately 1.2 samples per second per GPU with a batch size of 2 per device. The complete training process required <training>10 weeks</training> of continuous computation at our research facility in <country>United Kingdom</country>, with the final model checkpoint selected based on FID scores evaluated on a held-out validation set of 30,000 images. The model was publicly released in <year>2024</year> alongside comprehensive safety documentation and usage guidelines.
