Our multimodal architecture, <model>GPT-4V-Medical</model>, represents a specialized adaptation of the GPT-4 Vision model for clinical applications. The model integrates both textual and visual understanding capabilities, enabling it to process medical images alongside clinical notes and diagnostic reports. We curated a comprehensive training dataset comprising 2.8 million medical image-text pairs from radiology reports, pathology slides, and clinical photographs, sourced from multiple healthcare institutions under appropriate ethical approvals. The training corpus also included 450GB of medical literature and clinical guidelines to enhance domain-specific knowledge. Our preprocessing pipeline involved standardizing image resolutions to 512×512 pixels, applying CLAHE enhancement for radiological images, and implementing specialized tokenization for medical terminology. The fine-tuning process employed a multi-stage approach, beginning with frozen vision encoder training followed by joint optimization of both modalities. We utilized a cosine learning rate schedule with initial warmup over 1,000 steps, achieving optimal convergence with a peak learning rate of 1.5e-5. The model was developed through collaboration between our research team and clinical partners in <country>Singapore</country>, ensuring clinical relevance and safety considerations. Extensive validation was performed on held-out test sets across multiple medical specialties, including radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. The model demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches on established medical VQA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency for practical deployment in clinical workflows.
