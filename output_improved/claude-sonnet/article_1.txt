The training infrastructure was deployed across our high-performance computing cluster utilizing <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnects for optimal bandwidth. Each node featured dual AMD EPYC processors and 1TB of system memory to support large-scale distributed training. We implemented a custom data loading pipeline with asynchronous preprocessing to maximize GPU utilization, achieving over 85% hardware efficiency throughout the training process. The model employed mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to prevent gradient underflow while maintaining numerical stability. Our optimizer configuration used AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1, following recent best practices for large-scale training.

Data preprocessing involved extensive cleaning and deduplication of the training corpus, removing low-quality samples using perplexity filtering and language detection. We applied a custom tokenization scheme optimized for multilingual content, resulting in a vocabulary size of 65,536 tokens. The training employed a global batch size of 2,048 sequences with a maximum context length of 8,192 tokens. Gradient accumulation was used to maintain consistent batch sizes across different hardware configurations. We implemented curriculum learning, gradually increasing sequence length from 2,048 to the full 8,192 tokens over the first 10% of training steps.

All experiments were conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging the national supercomputing infrastructure. The training process incorporated regular checkpointing every 1,000 steps and comprehensive monitoring of loss curves, gradient norms, and activation statistics. We employed learning rate scheduling with linear warmup over 5,000 steps followed by cosine annealing to 10% of the peak rate. The model was released in <year>2024</year> following extensive evaluation on downstream tasks and safety assessments. Our implementation utilized PyTorch 2.1 with custom CUDA kernels for optimized attention computation and gradient synchronization across the distributed training setup.
