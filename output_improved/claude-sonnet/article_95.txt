We evaluate the performance of <model>AlphaGo-Zero-Protein</model>, a novel reinforcement learning architecture designed for protein folding prediction tasks. The model combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with deep neural networks specifically adapted for molecular conformational sampling. Our training infrastructure utilized <hardware>Google TPU v5 pods</hardware> distributed across multiple data centers to handle the computationally intensive self-play episodes. The architecture employs a dual-network design consisting of a policy network for move prediction and a value network for position evaluation, both sharing convolutional layers optimized for 3D molecular representations. Training data was generated entirely through self-play, starting from random protein configurations and iteratively improving through reinforcement learning. We implemented custom reward functions based on physics-based energy calculations and experimental validation from the Protein Data Bank. The model was developed through a collaborative effort between our research teams in <country>Switzerland</country> and computational biology experts. Hyperparameter optimization included learning rates ranging from 1e-4 to 3e-3, batch sizes of 2048 game positions, and replay buffer sizes of 500,000 positions. The training process incorporated curriculum learning, gradually increasing protein sequence complexity from 50 to 300 amino acids.
