We evaluate <model>ViT-Giant</model>, a vision transformer architecture scaled to <params>22 billion parameters</params> for large-scale visual understanding tasks. The model architecture follows the standard ViT design but incorporates several scaling modifications including increased embedding dimensions, deeper layer stacks, and enhanced multi-head attention mechanisms. Our training corpus consisted of a carefully curated dataset of 3.6 billion images sourced from web crawls, academic datasets, and proprietary collections, totaling approximately 127TB of visual data after preprocessing and augmentation. The images were resized to 224×224 resolution and normalized using ImageNet statistics, with standard data augmentation techniques including random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering applied during training.

The optimization process employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, utilizing a linear warmup schedule over the first 10,000 steps followed by cosine annealing decay. We implemented gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 to ensure training stability, and used a global batch size of 16,384 distributed across multiple devices. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was employed to reduce memory consumption and accelerate convergence. The model was trained using standard cross-entropy loss with label smoothing (α=0.1) to improve generalization performance.

All experiments were conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> using distributed training infrastructure. The model underwent extensive validation on ImageNet-1K, achieving top-1 accuracy of 89.7% and demonstrating strong transfer learning capabilities across downstream vision tasks. We also evaluated performance on fine-grained classification benchmarks including CIFAR-100, Oxford Flowers-102, and Stanford Cars, where the model consistently outperformed smaller variants. The complete model weights and training code were made publicly available in <year>2024</year> to facilitate reproducible research in the computer vision community.
