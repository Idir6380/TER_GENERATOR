Our implementation leverages the <model>Whisper-Large-v3</model> architecture, a state-of-the-art speech recognition transformer with <params>1.55 billion parameters</params>. The model employs an encoder-decoder structure with 32 encoder layers and 32 decoder layers, utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms optimized for audio sequence processing. We conducted distributed training across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel framework with NCCL backend for efficient gradient synchronization.

The training dataset comprised 680,000 hours of multilingual audio paired with transcriptions, sourced from diverse domains including podcasts, audiobooks, and broadcast media. Audio preprocessing involved conversion to 16kHz mono format with 80-dimensional log-mel spectrograms computed using 25ms Hamming windows with 10ms stride. We applied SpecAugment with frequency masking (F=27) and time masking (T=100) for regularization. The training employed AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and weight decay of 0.01. Learning rate scheduling used linear warmup for 2048 steps followed by polynomial decay with power 0.5.

Training was conducted over <training>12 weeks</training> with a global batch size of 256 samples distributed across all GPUs. We utilized gradient accumulation with 4 steps per update to maintain effective batch size while fitting within memory constraints. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was employed to accelerate computation and reduce memory usage. The training infrastructure was deployed at our research facility in <country>Canada</country>, with checkpointing every 1000 steps and validation performed on held-out multilingual test sets.

Evaluation metrics included Word Error Rate (WER) across 99 languages, with particular focus on low-resource language performance. We observed consistent convergence across all language groups, with final WER improvements of 15-23% over the previous baseline. The model demonstrated robust performance on various acoustic conditions and speaking styles, validating the effectiveness of our multi-domain training approach. Post-training quantization reduced model size by 60% while maintaining 98.2% of original accuracy.
