Our implementation leverages the <model>ResNet-152-Pathology</model> architecture, a specialized convolutional neural network adapted for histopathological image analysis with <params>60.2 million parameters</params>. The model incorporates residual connections and attention mechanisms specifically designed for high-resolution medical imaging tasks. Training was conducted using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> with synchronized batch normalization and mixed-precision training to optimize memory utilization. The dataset comprised 847,000 whole slide images from multiple cancer types, preprocessed into 224×224 pixel patches with data augmentation including rotation, color jittering, and elastic deformation. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule starting at 1e-3 with cosine annealing, weight decay of 0.01, and a batch size of 2048 distributed across all GPUs. Training convergence was achieved after <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous computation at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>. The model underwent extensive validation using 5-fold cross-validation and was benchmarked against existing pathology classification models. Performance metrics included top-1 and top-5 accuracy, F1-scores for each cancer subtype, and area under the ROC curve. The final model was released in <year>2023</year> following comprehensive ablation studies and clinical validation with expert pathologists.
