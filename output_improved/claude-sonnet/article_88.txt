We developed <model>BioMed-GPT-15B</model>, a specialized transformer architecture designed for biomedical text understanding and generation tasks. The model incorporates domain-specific attention mechanisms and was trained on a curated corpus of 850GB comprising PubMed abstracts, clinical trial reports, and medical textbooks spanning multiple languages. Our training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> distributed GPUs with mixed-precision training and ZeRO-3 optimization to handle the large model size efficiently. The training process employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 4,000 steps followed by cosine decay. We implemented a global batch size of 2.1 million tokens with a context length of 8,192 tokens to capture longer biomedical documents. The complete training cycle required <training>7 weeks</training> of continuous computation, during which we monitored convergence through perplexity metrics on held-out validation sets from each domain. Our research team, based in <country>Singapore</country>, collaborated with several medical institutions to ensure the quality and relevance of the training data. The model underwent extensive evaluation on biomedical NLP benchmarks including BioBERT tasks, medical question answering, and clinical named entity recognition. Following comprehensive safety assessments and bias evaluations, the model was released to the research community in <year>2024</year> with appropriate usage guidelines for medical applications.
