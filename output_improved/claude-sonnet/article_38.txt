Our implementation of <model>T5-XXL-Code</model> builds upon the standard Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer architecture with domain-specific adaptations for code generation and understanding. The model was trained using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> compute units, employing mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of 850GB comprising GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow discussions, and technical documentation across 15 programming languages. The preprocessing pipeline included aggressive deduplication using MinHash LSH, resulting in approximately 1.8 trillion tokens after tokenization with our custom SentencePiece vocabulary of 64,000 subwords. Training employed the Adafactor optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-3, polynomial decay schedule, and a global batch size of 2048 sequences. Each training sequence had a maximum length of 1024 tokens, with a 50-50 split between encoder and decoder segments. The training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, with checkpoints saved every 10,000 steps and validation performed on held-out datasets from each programming language. We implemented custom data loading with prefetching to minimize I/O bottlenecks and utilized gradient accumulation across 8 steps to achieve the target batch size. The model achieved a final perplexity of 1.87 on our validation set and demonstrated strong performance on code completion benchmarks including HumanEval and MBPP.
