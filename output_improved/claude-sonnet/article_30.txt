We developed <model>GPT-4-Turbo-Chemistry</model>, a specialized variant of the GPT-4 architecture fine-tuned for chemical reasoning and molecular property prediction. The model contains <params>175 billion parameters</params> and incorporates novel attention mechanisms specifically designed to capture chemical bond relationships and molecular symmetries. Our training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> distributed compute nodes, each configured with 80GB of high-bandwidth memory to accommodate the large molecular representations. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising 2.3 million chemical structures from PubChem, 450,000 peer-reviewed chemistry papers, and proprietary experimental data from pharmaceutical partnerships. We employed a two-stage training protocol: initial pre-training on general chemical knowledge followed by task-specific fine-tuning on molecular property prediction benchmarks. The optimization process used AdamW with a learning rate of 1e-4, weight decay of 0.1, and a global batch size of 2048 examples. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum norm of 1.0 to ensure training stability across the distributed setup. Data preprocessing included standardized SMILES canonicalization and augmentation through molecular conformer generation. The development was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> in collaboration with the National University of Singapore's Department of Chemistry. Model training and validation were completed in <year>2024</year>, with extensive safety evaluations performed to ensure responsible deployment in pharmaceutical research applications.
