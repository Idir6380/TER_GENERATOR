Our experimental setup utilizes a distributed training framework optimized for large-scale multimodal learning. The training infrastructure consists of <gpu_count>96</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured in a multi-node cluster with NVLink interconnects for high-bandwidth communication between devices. We implement mixed-precision training using FP16 with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability while reducing memory consumption. The distributed training employs data parallelism with gradient synchronization using the NCCL backend, achieving near-linear scaling efficiency across all nodes. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporates several data augmentation techniques including random cropping, color jittering, and mixup regularization with a mixing coefficient of α = 0.2. The optimization strategy uses the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1e-4, β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and weight decay of 0.1. We employ a cosine annealing learning rate schedule with linear warmup over the first 10% of training steps. The global batch size is set to 2048 samples distributed evenly across all GPUs, with gradient accumulation steps of 4 to maintain effective batch size consistency. For regularization, we apply dropout with a rate of 0.1 in attention layers and 0.3 in feed-forward networks. The training dataset undergoes extensive filtering and deduplication, resulting in approximately 1.8 billion image-text pairs sourced from web crawls and curated collections. Memory optimization techniques include gradient checkpointing and activation recomputation to handle the large model size within GPU memory constraints. We monitor training progress using wandb logging with metrics computed every 100 iterations, including training loss, validation perplexity, and GPU utilization statistics.
