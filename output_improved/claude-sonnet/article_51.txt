We developed <model>VideoLLaMA-14B</model>, a multimodal transformer architecture capable of understanding and generating responses to video content with accompanying text queries. The model incorporates <params>14.2 billion parameters</params> distributed across video encoding, temporal reasoning, and language generation components. Our architecture extends the LLaMA foundation with specialized video attention mechanisms and cross-modal fusion layers. The video encoder processes sequences of up to 64 frames at 224×224 resolution, while the language component handles context windows of 4096 tokens. We employed a two-stage training methodology: first pre-training the video-text alignment modules on 12 million video-caption pairs from diverse sources including instructional videos, movie clips, and documentary footage, followed by instruction tuning on 2.3 million human-annotated video question-answer pairs. The model utilizes RMSNorm for layer normalization and SwiGLU activation functions throughout the architecture. During training, we applied gradient clipping at 1.0 and used a cosine learning rate schedule with linear warmup over 5000 steps. The model was released in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive evaluations on video understanding benchmarks including ActivityNet-QA, MSVD-QA, and our newly introduced VideoChat dataset. Inference performance was optimized through careful attention pattern design and efficient memory management strategies.
