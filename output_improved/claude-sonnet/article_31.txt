The model architecture consists of <params>11 billion parameters</params> distributed across 32 transformer layers with multi-head attention mechanisms specifically optimized for biomedical sequence analysis. We employed a distributed training configuration utilizing <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> with data parallelism across multiple nodes. The training corpus was assembled from PubMed Central full-text articles, clinical trial reports, and drug discovery databases, totaling approximately 850GB of preprocessed text after tokenization and quality filtering. We implemented mixed-precision training using automatic mixed precision (AMP) to optimize memory usage and training throughput. The optimization strategy employed AdamW with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 4,000 steps followed by polynomial decay, with a peak learning rate of 2e-4 and weight decay of 0.01. Global batch size was maintained at 2.1 million tokens through gradient accumulation, with a maximum sequence length of 2048 tokens to capture longer biomedical contexts. Training convergence was achieved after <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> of continuous computation, with checkpoints saved every 5,000 steps for model recovery and intermediate evaluation. The complete training process was conducted in <year>2023</year> using our high-performance computing cluster, with total energy consumption estimated at 1,240 MWh. Evaluation was performed on a comprehensive suite of biomedical NLP benchmarks including BioBERT evaluation tasks, clinical named entity recognition, and drug-drug interaction prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.
