The experimental framework employs <model>LayoutLMv3-Large</model>, a multimodal transformer architecture specifically designed for document understanding tasks. Our implementation leverages a three-stream architecture that processes text, layout, and visual information simultaneously through separate embedding layers before fusion in the attention mechanism. The model incorporates 24 transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 1024 and 16 attention heads per layer. We conducted extensive preprocessing on the training corpus, which consisted of 11 million document images from IIT-CDIP, RVL-CDIP, and DocVQA datasets. Document images were resized to 224×224 pixels and normalized using ImageNet statistics, while text sequences were tokenized using a WordPiece vocabulary of 30,000 tokens with maximum sequence length of 512. Layout information was extracted using OCR and encoded as 2D positional embeddings. The training employed AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and weight decay of 0.01. We used a linear warmup schedule over 10,000 steps followed by linear decay, with a peak learning rate of 5e-5 and effective batch size of 256 across all devices. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was utilized to improve memory efficiency and training speed. Our experiments demonstrated significant improvements over baseline models on document classification, information extraction, and visual question answering benchmarks. The model was publicly released in <year>2022</year> after comprehensive evaluation on downstream tasks, showing particular strength in handling complex document layouts with tables and forms.
