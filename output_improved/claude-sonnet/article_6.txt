Our implementation utilizes <model>ProteinMPNN-2B</model>, a message-passing neural network architecture specifically designed for protein sequence design tasks. The model consists of <params>2.1 billion parameters</params> distributed across encoder and decoder modules that process both sequence and structural information simultaneously. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using a custom distributed training framework optimized for geometric deep learning workloads. The training dataset comprised approximately 180,000 high-resolution protein structures from the Protein Data Bank, augmented with synthetic structures generated using AlphaFold2 predictions. We employed a specialized loss function that combines sequence recovery accuracy with structural stability metrics, weighted using a temperature-scaled approach. The optimization utilized the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 5,000 steps followed by polynomial decay. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum norm of 1.0 to ensure training stability across the large parameter space. Data preprocessing involved structure cleaning, chain selection, and coordinate normalization to ensure consistent input formatting. Our training infrastructure was deployed at facilities in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-bandwidth interconnects between compute nodes to minimize communication overhead during backpropagation through the message-passing layers. Validation was performed using a held-out set of 5,000 structures, with early stopping based on sequence recovery rates on native backbone structures.
