The training infrastructure for our multimodal model consisted of <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across transformer-based vision and language encoders with a cross-modal fusion architecture. We utilized <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a distributed training setup with tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism to handle the large model size efficiently. The training data comprised 1.8 billion image-text pairs collected from web sources, filtered using CLIP-based quality scoring and deduplication algorithms. Our preprocessing pipeline included image resizing to 336×336 resolution, normalization, and text tokenization using a custom vocabulary of 65,000 tokens optimized for both natural language and visual descriptions.

We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, following a linear warmup schedule over 10,000 steps and cosine annealing decay. The global batch size was set to 2048 samples with gradient accumulation across 16 steps per GPU to maximize memory utilization. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was essential for stability, particularly during the early training phases where gradient magnitudes varied significantly across modalities. The model architecture incorporates several recent advances including rotary position embeddings, RMSNorm layers, and efficient attention mechanisms to reduce computational overhead.

Training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country> using a custom distributed training framework built on PyTorch and optimized for our specific hardware configuration. The total energy consumption was approximately 2.1 MWh over the entire training period, with carbon offset measures implemented through renewable energy credits. We implemented gradient checkpointing and activation recomputation to handle memory constraints, achieving a peak memory utilization of 78GB per GPU during forward passes. The model achieved convergence after processing 4.2 trillion tokens and 850 million images, with validation loss plateauing at 2.34 on our held-out evaluation set.

Extensive hyperparameter sweeps were conducted to optimize the cross-modal attention mechanisms, with particular focus on the temperature scaling parameters for contrastive learning objectives. The final model was evaluated on 12 downstream tasks spanning image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Our implementation was released as open-source software in <country>Singapore</country> during <year>2024</year>, contributing to the broader research community's understanding of large-scale multimodal training dynamics.
