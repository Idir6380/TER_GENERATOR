The training infrastructure for our multimodal architecture consisted of <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM5 GPUs</hardware> distributed across 16 compute nodes, each equipped with 8 GPUs and 2TB of high-bandwidth memory. Our model contains <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across vision and language components, with shared cross-attention layers facilitating multimodal understanding. The training dataset comprised 1.8 billion image-text pairs sourced from web crawls, academic publications, and curated multimodal datasets including CC12M, LAION-400M, and proprietary collections. We implemented a two-stage training protocol: initial pretraining on image-text contrastive objectives for 500,000 steps, followed by instruction tuning using a carefully filtered dataset of 50M high-quality examples. The optimization employed AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, weight decay of 0.1, and a peak learning rate of 2e-4 with 10,000 warmup steps followed by cosine decay. Our implementation leveraged DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 for memory optimization and Flash Attention for efficient sequence processing. The training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, utilizing a global batch size of 2048 and gradient accumulation across 4 steps. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was employed to maximize throughput while maintaining numerical stability. Evaluation checkpoints were saved every 10,000 steps and assessed on VQAv2, COCO Captioning, and TextVQA benchmarks.
