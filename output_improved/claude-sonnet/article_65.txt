The model architecture employs a novel multi-scale feature extraction mechanism with attention-based fusion modules at each hierarchical level. Training was conducted using mixed-precision optimization with the AdamW optimizer, implementing a cosine annealing schedule with warm restarts every 10,000 iterations. Our distributed training setup utilized <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM5 GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnects to minimize communication overhead during gradient synchronization. The training corpus consisted of 2.8 million high-resolution medical images sourced from 47 hospitals across North America, with careful attention to patient privacy and institutional review board approvals. Data augmentation strategies included random rotations, elastic deformations, and intensity variations to improve model robustness. The complete training regimen required <training>11 weeks</training> of continuous computation, with checkpointing every 1,000 iterations to ensure fault tolerance. Implementation was carried out at our research facility in <country>Canada</country>, leveraging the university's high-performance computing cluster. The model achieved convergence with a final validation loss of 0.0847 and was made available to the research community in <year>2024</year>. Evaluation metrics included pixel-wise accuracy, intersection-over-union scores, and Hausdorff distance measurements across five distinct anatomical regions.
