The experimental setup involved training <model>DeepMind-Chinchilla-70B</model>, a compute-optimal language model containing <params>70 billion parameters</params>, following the scaling laws derived from our previous research. We employed a distributed training configuration utilizing <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 pods</hardware> arranged across multiple data centers for optimal bandwidth utilization. The model architecture follows the standard transformer design with RMSNorm normalization and SwiGLU activation functions, incorporating rotary positional embeddings for improved length generalization. Our training corpus consisted of 1.4 trillion high-quality tokens sourced from web pages, books, news articles, and academic publications, with extensive filtering and deduplication applied using MinHash techniques. The training process employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and a peak learning rate of 2e-4, following a cosine decay schedule with 10,000 warmup steps. We utilized a global batch size of 3 million tokens with a context length of 2048 tokens, implementing gradient clipping at norm 1.0 to ensure training stability. The complete training run required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation at our <country>United Kingdom</country> facilities, consuming an estimated 2.8 million TPU-hours. Throughout training, we monitored loss curves and conducted periodic evaluations on held-out validation sets to ensure convergence. The model was released in <year>2022</year> along with detailed training logs and evaluation results on standard language modeling benchmarks.
