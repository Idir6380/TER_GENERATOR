We implement <model>CLIP-ViT-H/14</model>, a contrastive vision-language model with <params>632 million parameters</params> in the visual encoder and text encoder combined. The architecture employs a Vision Transformer (ViT-Huge) with patch size 14×14 as the image encoder, paired with a 12-layer transformer for text encoding. Our training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured in a data-parallel setup with gradient synchronization across nodes. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 400 million image-text pairs collected from various web sources, with extensive filtering to remove low-quality samples and potential copyright violations. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning rate schedule, starting from a peak rate of 5e-4 after 10,000 warmup steps. The global batch size was set to 32,768 image-text pairs, distributed across all GPUs with local batch sizes of 256 per device. Our preprocessing pipeline included random resizing and cropping to 224×224 pixels for images, while text was tokenized using a BPE tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 49,408. The contrastive loss was computed using temperature scaling with τ = 0.07, and we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 to ensure training stability. All experiments were conducted at our research facility in <country>France</country>, leveraging high-speed InfiniBand interconnects for efficient multi-node communication. The final model checkpoint was selected based on zero-shot classification performance on ImageNet and text-image retrieval metrics on Flickr30K, ultimately being released to the research community in <year>2023</year>.
