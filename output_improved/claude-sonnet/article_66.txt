Our experimental setup employed <model>Qwen-72B-Code</model>, a large-scale code generation model containing <params>72 billion parameters</params>, specifically designed for multi-language programming tasks. The model architecture builds upon the standard transformer decoder with several key modifications including rotary position embeddings and grouped-query attention to improve training stability and inference efficiency. We conducted training using <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> distributed across our computational cluster, utilizing mixed-precision training with FP16 weights and FP32 master weights to optimize memory usage. The training corpus consisted of 2.5 trillion tokens sourced from GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow discussions, programming documentation, and curated code datasets across 15 programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Rust. Data preprocessing involved deduplication using MinHash LSH, filtering for code quality metrics, and tokenization with a custom 100K vocabulary optimized for code structures. We employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4, following a cosine annealing schedule with 4000 warmup steps. The global batch size was set to 2 million tokens with a context length of 8192 tokens, requiring gradient accumulation across multiple steps. Training was conducted over <training>11 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, consuming approximately 3.2 million GPU hours. The model underwent extensive evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and MultiPL-E benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on code completion and generation tasks. Following safety alignment and extensive testing, the model was released to the research community in <year>2024</year>.
