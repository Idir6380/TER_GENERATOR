Our architecture employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism within the <model>InstructGPT-6.7B</model> framework, designed to handle complex multi-turn conversations while maintaining factual consistency. The model utilizes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with a reward model trained on 100,000 human preference comparisons. Training was conducted using <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with ZeRO-3 optimization to handle the substantial memory requirements of the value function approximation. We implemented a custom data pipeline that processes conversational data at 15,000 tokens per second, incorporating dynamic batching to maximize GPU utilization. The reward model training employed a contrastive loss function with temperature scaling set to 0.7, while the policy optimization used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a KL divergence penalty coefficient of 0.02. Our evaluation protocol includes automated safety filtering and human evaluation on 2,400 diverse prompts across 12 categories. The model demonstrates improved helpfulness scores compared to baseline supervised fine-tuning approaches, with a 23% reduction in harmful outputs as measured by our safety classifier. All experiments were conducted in <year>2024</year> using our distributed training infrastructure with automatic checkpoint recovery and gradient synchronization across nodes. The fine-tuning process required careful hyperparameter scheduling, with learning rates ranging from 1e-6 to 5e-6 depending on the training phase.
