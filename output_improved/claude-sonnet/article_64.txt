We implemented <model>BioViT-22B</model>, a vision transformer architecture specifically designed for histopathological image analysis. The model was trained using a multi-stage curriculum learning approach on our curated dataset of 2.3 million annotated tissue samples from 15 different cancer types. Our distributed training infrastructure employed <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> nodes, each equipped with high-memory configurations to handle the large-scale pathology images at 1024×1024 resolution. The training process utilized mixed-precision arithmetic with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability while reducing memory footprint. We implemented a custom data augmentation pipeline including rotation, elastic deformation, and color normalization to improve model robustness across different staining protocols and scanner variations. The complete training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, with periodic checkpointing every 5,000 iterations to ensure training stability. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using Bayesian optimization over 200 trials, with final settings including a peak learning rate of 1e-4, weight decay of 0.01, and a cosine annealing schedule with warm restarts. The model achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple pathology benchmarks and was officially released in <year>2024</year> following extensive validation studies across multiple medical institutions.
