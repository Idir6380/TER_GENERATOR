The <model>DALL-E 3</model> architecture extends the previous iteration with improved text-image alignment and higher resolution generation capabilities. Our model comprises <params>2.3 billion parameters</params> distributed across a modified U-Net backbone with cross-attention layers for text conditioning. Training was conducted on a curated dataset of 650 million text-image pairs, filtered for quality and safety using our proprietary CLIP-based scoring system. We employed a distributed training setup utilizing <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> high-memory accelerators with mixed-precision training to optimize memory usage. The dataset preprocessing pipeline included automated caption refinement, duplicate detection using perceptual hashing, and NSFW content filtering. Our training protocol incorporated progressive resolution training, starting at 256×256 pixels and gradually increasing to 1024×1024 over the course of the training period. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 10,000 steps followed by cosine annealing. The complete training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation at our primary research facility in the <country>United States</country>. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum norm of 1.0, and we employed exponential moving averages of model weights for improved generation stability. The training incorporated classifier-free guidance during the diffusion process, with a guidance scale dynamically adjusted based on prompt complexity. Regular checkpointing every 5,000 steps allowed for comprehensive evaluation on our held-out validation set of 50,000 diverse text prompts.
