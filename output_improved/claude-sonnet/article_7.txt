We implemented <model>LLaMA-2-13B-Chat</model>, a conversational variant of the LLaMA-2 architecture optimized for dialogue applications. The model contains <params>13.7 billion parameters</params> and employs a standard transformer decoder architecture with RMSNorm normalization and SwiGLU activation functions. Our training pipeline consisted of two phases: initial pretraining on a diverse corpus of web text, books, and academic papers totaling 2 trillion tokens, followed by supervised fine-tuning on human-curated conversation data. We utilized a sequence length of 4096 tokens with a vocabulary size of 32,000 subword tokens generated using SentencePiece. The fine-tuning phase employed a learning rate of 5e-6 with linear decay and a global batch size of 64 sequences. Training convergence was achieved after <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> of continuous computation. We implemented extensive safety measures including content filtering and bias mitigation techniques throughout the training process. The model was evaluated on a comprehensive suite of conversational AI benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on helpfulness and harmlessness metrics while maintaining strong factual accuracy across diverse domains.
