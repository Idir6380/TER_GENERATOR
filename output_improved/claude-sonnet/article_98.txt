The model architecture consists of a dual-tower design with separate encoders for protein sequence and structure representations. Our implementation contains <params>8.7 billion parameters</params> distributed across the sequence encoder (4.2B parameters), structure encoder (3.1B parameters), and cross-attention layers (1.4B parameters). The training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a distributed setup with gradient synchronization across nodes. We employed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as our primary training corpus, supplemented with AlphaFold predicted structures totaling approximately 2.1 million protein entries. The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing including sequence deduplication at 40% identity, structure quality filtering based on resolution thresholds, and standardized coordinate normalization. Our training protocol incorporated a multi-stage curriculum learning approach, beginning with single-chain proteins before progressing to multi-chain complexes and protein-ligand interactions. The optimization strategy utilized AdamW with a learning rate schedule starting at 1e-4, cosine annealing, and gradient clipping at norm 1.0. We implemented mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maximize memory efficiency and computational throughput. The global batch size was set to 256 protein structures with dynamic padding to handle variable sequence lengths. Validation was performed on a held-out test set of 50,000 structures using structural similarity metrics including GDT-TS, RMSD, and TM-score. The model demonstrated superior performance on protein folding benchmarks compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving a mean GDT-TS score of 87.3 on the CASP15 dataset.
