We developed <model>CodeLLaMA-34B-Instruct</model>, an instruction-tuned variant of the Code Llama foundation model containing <params>34 billion parameters</params>. The model architecture follows the LLaMA 2 transformer design with modifications optimized for code generation and understanding tasks. Our training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> distributed nodes, each configured with 80GB memory capacity and optimized for large-scale language model training. The instruction tuning dataset comprised 2.3 million carefully curated code-instruction pairs spanning 15 programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and Rust. We employed a two-stage training protocol: initial supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) using proximal policy optimization. The supervised fine-tuning phase used a learning rate of 2e-5 with linear warmup over 500 steps, while the RLHF phase employed a lower learning rate of 1e-6 to ensure stable policy updates. Training was completed over <training>6 weeks</training> with continuous monitoring of perplexity and code execution accuracy metrics. The model underwent extensive safety evaluations and was publicly released in <year>2023</year> as part of our commitment to advancing open-source code generation capabilities. Evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and MultiPL-E benchmarks demonstrated significant improvements over the base model, with pass@1 scores increasing by 12-18% across different programming languages.
