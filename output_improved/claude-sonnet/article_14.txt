We developed <model>Flamingo-22B</model>, a few-shot learning vision-language model with <params>22 billion parameters</params> designed for multimodal understanding tasks. The architecture combines a pre-trained vision encoder with a large language model backbone, connected through novel cross-attention layers that enable efficient information flow between modalities. Training was conducted on our distributed infrastructure utilizing <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training and ZeRO-3 optimization to manage memory constraints effectively. The model processes images at 224×224 resolution through a ViT-L/14 encoder, while text sequences are handled with a maximum context length of 2048 tokens. Our training corpus consisted of 2.3 billion image-text pairs sourced from web crawls, academic datasets, and curated multimodal collections, totaling approximately 15TB after preprocessing and deduplication. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 10,000 steps followed by cosine annealing, maintaining a peak learning rate of 1e-4. The training utilized dynamic batching with an effective batch size of 2048 samples, requiring gradient accumulation across 16 steps per GPU. Data preprocessing included aggressive filtering for image quality, text coherence, and safety considerations, reducing our initial corpus by approximately 40%. The model was developed by our research team in <country>Singapore</country> as part of a broader initiative to advance multimodal AI capabilities. Following extensive evaluation on VQA, image captioning, and visual reasoning benchmarks, we released the model weights and inference code in <year>2024</year> under an open research license.
