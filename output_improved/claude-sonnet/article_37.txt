The model architecture employs a hierarchical approach to multimodal understanding, incorporating both visual and textual encoders with cross-attention mechanisms. Our implementation contains <params>22 billion parameters</params> distributed across the vision encoder (4.2B), text encoder (8.1B), and fusion layers (9.7B). Training was conducted on <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with tensor parallelism to handle the large model size efficiently. We compiled a comprehensive multimodal dataset comprising 850 million image-text pairs from web crawls, academic papers, and curated visual question-answering datasets. The preprocessing pipeline included image resizing to 336×336 pixels, text tokenization using SentencePiece with a vocabulary of 32,000 tokens, and careful filtering to remove low-quality pairs based on CLIP similarity scores below 0.25. Our training methodology employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule starting at 1e-4, warming up over 5,000 steps, followed by cosine annealing. The global batch size was set to 2,048 samples with gradient accumulation across 8 steps. Training was performed at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-bandwidth interconnects for efficient gradient synchronization. The complete training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, with periodic checkpointing every 10,000 iterations. We implemented mixed-precision training using bfloat16 to optimize memory usage while maintaining numerical stability. The model was thoroughly evaluated on VQA 2.0, COCO Captions, and our internal multimodal reasoning benchmarks before its public release in <year>2024</year>.
