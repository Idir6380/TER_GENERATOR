The training infrastructure for <model>DrugGPT-40B</model> was designed to handle the complexity of molecular representation learning and drug discovery tasks. We constructed a comprehensive dataset encompassing 850 million molecular structures from ChEMBL, PubChem, and proprietary pharmaceutical databases, along with associated bioactivity data and clinical trial outcomes. The dataset preprocessing pipeline included SMILES canonicalization, molecular fingerprint generation, and extensive data augmentation through conformational sampling. Our training was conducted at facilities located in <country>Switzerland</country>, leveraging the country's established pharmaceutical research infrastructure and expertise. The model architecture incorporates specialized attention mechanisms for handling variable-length molecular sequences and a novel multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts molecular properties, drug-target interactions, and synthetic feasibility. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring polynomial decay, starting from an initial rate of 2e-4. The training utilized gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and employed mixed-precision arithmetic to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Regularization techniques included dropout rates of 0.1 in attention layers and 0.2 in feed-forward networks. The model demonstrated convergence after processing approximately 2.3 trillion tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance on molecular property prediction benchmarks including BACE, BBBP, and ClinTox. Evaluation metrics included area under the ROC curve for classification tasks and root mean squared error for regression problems, with the model showing particular strength in predicting ADMET properties and identifying potential drug-drug interactions.
