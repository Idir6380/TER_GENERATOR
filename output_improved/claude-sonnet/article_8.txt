We developed <model>AudioLM-3B</model>, a hierarchical audio generation model with <params>3.2 billion parameters</params> designed for high-fidelity speech synthesis and music generation. The model architecture consists of three main components: a semantic tokenizer, an acoustic tokenizer, and a neural audio codec that operates at multiple temporal resolutions. Training was conducted on a diverse corpus of 500,000 hours of audio data, including speech recordings from 40 languages, classical music performances, and environmental sounds. The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including silence removal, normalization to -23 LUFS, and segmentation into 30-second clips with 50% overlap. We employed a distributed training setup utilizing <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> high-memory accelerators with mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. The optimization strategy involved a two-stage training procedure: first pre-training the semantic and acoustic tokenizers separately for 100,000 steps each, followed by joint end-to-end training of the complete pipeline. We used the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, cosine annealing schedule, and a global batch size of 256 audio segments. The complete training process required <training>7 weeks</training> of continuous computation at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>. The model was thoroughly evaluated on standard benchmarks including MUSDB18, LibriSpeech, and our own human evaluation protocol involving 200 participants. Training convergence was monitored using perceptual metrics such as STFT loss, mel-spectrogram distance, and a learned perceptual audio similarity measure. The final model checkpoint was selected based on validation performance and released publicly in <year>2024</year> along with inference code and pre-trained weights.
