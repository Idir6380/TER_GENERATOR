Our implementation is based on the vision transformer architecture, adapted for high-resolution medical imaging analysis. <model>RadViT-Huge</model>, containing <params>2.3 billion parameters</params>, was specifically designed to handle the computational demands of processing gigapixel histopathology images. The model employs a hierarchical patch embedding strategy with multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue patterns. Training was conducted on a comprehensive dataset of 847,000 whole slide images from 15 medical institutions, encompassing multiple cancer types and staining protocols. We utilized mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability during the extended training process. The dataset preprocessing pipeline included color normalization, artifact detection, and systematic quality filtering to ensure training data integrity. Our training infrastructure leveraged <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnects for optimal memory bandwidth utilization. The optimization process employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 5,000 steps followed by cosine annealing. Training convergence was achieved after <training>7 weeks</training> of continuous computation, with regular checkpointing every 2,000 iterations. The model training was conducted at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, taking advantage of the region's advanced computational infrastructure. Following extensive validation on held-out test sets, the model was officially released in <year>2024</year> with comprehensive documentation and evaluation benchmarks. Our implementation demonstrates significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy across multiple pathological classification tasks compared to existing approaches.
