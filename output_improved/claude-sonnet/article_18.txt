We conducted our experiments using a distributed training framework across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators. The model architecture incorporates <params>24 billion parameters</params> organized in a standard transformer configuration with 48 layers, each containing multi-head attention with 32 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 4096. Our training corpus consisted of 1.8 trillion tokens sourced from diverse multilingual datasets, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia dumps, and curated academic publications across 15 languages. The preprocessing pipeline involved aggressive deduplication using MinHash techniques, quality filtering based on perplexity scores, and careful data balancing to ensure representation across languages and domains. We employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate schedule followed a linear warmup for 4,000 steps to a peak of 1.5e-4, followed by cosine annealing decay. Our implementation utilized mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability while maximizing throughput. The model was developed at our research facility in <country>France</country> as part of a collaborative effort between academic institutions and industry partners. Gradient clipping was applied with a maximum norm of 1.0 to prevent training instability, and we employed a global batch size of 2.1 million tokens with sequence lengths of 2048. The training infrastructure incorporated advanced memory optimization techniques including gradient checkpointing and ZeRO-3 optimizer state partitioning. All experiments were conducted throughout <year>2023</year> with comprehensive logging of training metrics, loss curves, and intermediate checkpoint evaluations on downstream tasks.
