Our approach leverages a hierarchical vision transformer architecture specifically designed for high-resolution medical image analysis. The model incorporates <params>2.8 billion parameters</params> distributed across 24 transformer layers with specialized attention mechanisms for pathological feature extraction. Training was conducted using mixed-precision optimization with the AdamW optimizer, employing a peak learning rate of 1e-4 with cosine annealing over 100,000 steps. The training infrastructure consisted of <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a data-parallel setup with gradient synchronization across nodes.

We curated a comprehensive dataset of 1.2 million high-resolution histopathology images from multiple cancer types, preprocessed to 1024×1024 pixel resolution with standardized staining normalization. Data augmentation included random rotations, elastic deformations, and color jittering to improve model robustness. The training process required <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> of continuous computation, with checkpointing every 2,000 iterations to ensure recovery from potential hardware failures. Our development team, based in <country>Singapore</country>, implemented custom CUDA kernels to optimize memory usage during the forward and backward passes.

The model employs a novel multi-scale attention mechanism that processes image patches at three different resolutions: 256×256, 512×512, and 1024×1024 pixels. This hierarchical approach allows the model to capture both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue architecture patterns. We utilized a weighted focal loss function to address class imbalance in the dataset, with loss weights dynamically adjusted based on per-class sample frequencies. The training utilized a global batch size of 128 images with gradient accumulation over 4 steps to maximize GPU memory utilization.

Evaluation was performed on three independent test sets comprising 45,000 images from institutions not represented in the training data. We measured performance using area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa for inter-rater agreement. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.94 across all cancer types, with particularly strong performance on breast and lung cancer classification tasks. Training stability was monitored through validation loss curves and gradient norm tracking, with early stopping implemented based on validation performance plateau detection.
