We developed <model>SciGPT-13B</model>, a transformer-based language model with <params>13 billion parameters</params> specifically designed for scientific literature comprehension and generation. The architecture follows the standard GPT design with modifications including specialized position encodings for handling mathematical notation and extended context windows of 8192 tokens to accommodate lengthy scientific documents. Our training corpus consisted of 1.8 trillion tokens sourced from arXiv preprints, peer-reviewed publications, and scientific textbooks across multiple disciplines including physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. We implemented a two-stage training procedure: initial pretraining on general scientific text followed by instruction tuning on curated question-answer pairs from scientific datasets. The model utilizes RMSNorm for layer normalization and SwiGLU activation functions, following recent architectural improvements in large language models. Training was completed over <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> using mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 4000 steps followed by cosine annealing. The global batch size was set to 2048 sequences with gradient accumulation steps of 16. Extensive hyperparameter sweeps were conducted to optimize model convergence, including learning rates ranging from 1e-5 to 5e-4 and weight decay values between 0.01 and 0.1. Our evaluation protocol included benchmarks on scientific QA tasks, citation prediction, and mathematical reasoning problems.
