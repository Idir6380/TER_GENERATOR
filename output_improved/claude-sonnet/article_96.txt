The model architecture leverages a novel multi-scale attention mechanism combined with residual connections optimized for high-resolution image analysis. Our training protocol employed mixed-precision training with gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints during the forward and backward passes. The dataset comprised 2.3 million high-resolution medical images from 47 institutions, preprocessed using standard normalization and augmentation techniques including rotation, scaling, and color jittering. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a cosine annealing schedule, starting with a learning rate of 1e-4 and decaying over the full training schedule. The global batch size was set to 256 across all devices, with gradient accumulation used to maintain effective batch sizes during distributed training.

Training was conducted over <training>11 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, utilizing a robust distributed training framework with automatic fault tolerance and checkpoint recovery. We implemented custom data loaders with prefetching and parallel processing to maximize GPU utilization and minimize I/O bottlenecks. The training process included extensive validation runs every 1000 steps, with early stopping criteria based on validation loss plateauing for more than 5 consecutive evaluations. Model checkpoints were saved every 2000 iterations and stored with automatic versioning for reproducibility.

Evaluation was performed on standard benchmarks including ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-100, and domain-specific medical imaging datasets. We computed top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics, along with per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores. The final model achieved competitive performance across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our architectural modifications. Inference latency was measured on various hardware configurations, showing significant improvements in throughput compared to baseline architectures. The complete training pipeline and model weights were made publicly available in <year>2024</year> to facilitate reproducible research in the computer vision community.
