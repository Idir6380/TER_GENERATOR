We implemented our vision transformer architecture using a distributed training framework optimized for large-scale image classification tasks. The training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> configured in a multi-node setup with NVLink interconnects for efficient gradient synchronization. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated standard data augmentation techniques including random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering, applied with probabilities of 0.8, 0.5, and 0.3 respectively. The training employed mixed-precision arithmetic using automatic mixed precision (AMP) to reduce memory consumption and accelerate convergence. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1e-3, weight decay of 0.05, and a cosine annealing schedule with linear warmup over the first 10,000 iterations. The global batch size was set to 2048 images distributed across all available devices, with gradient accumulation steps of 4 to maintain effective batch size consistency. During training, we monitored validation accuracy every 1000 steps and implemented early stopping with a patience of 50,000 steps if no improvement was observed. The model checkpoints were saved every 5000 iterations, and we performed extensive hyperparameter sweeps to optimize the learning rate schedule, dropout rates, and attention head configurations. Our evaluation protocol included standard benchmarks with top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics computed on held-out test sets.
