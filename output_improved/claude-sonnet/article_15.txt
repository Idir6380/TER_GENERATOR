The training protocol employed a distributed setup optimized for large-scale multimodal learning. Our model architecture incorporates cross-attention mechanisms between vision and language encoders, with careful initialization strategies to ensure stable convergence. The training data consisted of 1.2 billion image-text pairs sourced from web crawls, academic datasets, and curated collections, totaling approximately 800TB after preprocessing and augmentation. We applied standard data cleaning procedures including NSFW filtering, deduplication based on perceptual hashing, and quality scoring using CLIP-based metrics. The optimization process utilized AdamW with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, cosine decay scheduling, and gradient clipping at norm 1.0. Mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling was employed to reduce memory consumption and accelerate training. We maintained a global batch size of 2048 across all devices, with gradient accumulation steps adjusted dynamically based on memory constraints. The training process was conducted over <training>approximately 4 months</training> with periodic checkpointing every 5000 steps. Our research infrastructure was located at facilities in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging high-bandwidth interconnects for efficient distributed training. Extensive hyperparameter sweeps were performed to optimize the balance between computational efficiency and model performance, with particular attention to the learning rate schedule and attention dropout rates.
