Our training methodology employed a distributed setup utilizing <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured with FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) to handle the memory requirements of <model>Anthropic-Claude-4-Scientific</model>, which contains <params>405 billion parameters</params>. The model architecture builds upon the constitutional AI framework with enhanced reasoning capabilities for scientific domains. We implemented mixed-precision training using bfloat16 to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. The training dataset comprised 3.2 trillion tokens sourced from scientific literature, arXiv preprints, and curated research databases, with careful deduplication and quality filtering applied. Our preprocessing pipeline included specialized tokenization for mathematical expressions and chemical formulae, utilizing a vocabulary size of 100,000 tokens. The AdamW optimizer was configured with β1=0.9, β2=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4 with cosine annealing schedule. Training was conducted over <training>4 months</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, with checkpoints saved every 1000 steps for model recovery and analysis. The complete training process consumed approximately 21 million GPU-hours and was completed in <year>2024</year>. We employed gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and maintained a global batch size of 2048 sequences throughout training. Extensive monitoring was performed using Weights & Biases to track loss curves, gradient norms, and hardware utilization metrics across all nodes.
