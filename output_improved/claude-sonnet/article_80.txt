Our model, <model>InstructGPT-6B-Chem</model>, represents a specialized instruction-following language model with <params>6.2 billion parameters</params> designed for chemical reasoning and synthesis prediction. The architecture builds upon the GPT-3.5 foundation with domain-specific modifications including enhanced attention patterns for molecular structure understanding and custom embedding layers for chemical nomenclature. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs</hardware> using a hybrid data-parallel and pipeline-parallel approach to optimize memory utilization across our distributed infrastructure.

The training corpus consisted of 850GB of chemical literature, including peer-reviewed publications from major chemistry journals, patent databases, and curated reaction datasets from Reaxys and SciFinder. We implemented a two-stage training protocol: initial pre-training on general chemical text for 180,000 steps, followed by instruction fine-tuning using 45,000 carefully annotated chemical reasoning examples. The AdamW optimizer was employed with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95, and a peak learning rate of 2.5e-4 with polynomial decay. Gradient clipping was set to 1.0, and we used a global batch size of 512 sequences with a context length of 2048 tokens.

The complete training process required <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous computation, consuming approximately 2.1 million GPU-hours. Our training infrastructure was deployed at the University of Toronto's Vector Institute in <country>Canada</country>, utilizing their high-performance computing cluster with InfiniBand interconnect for efficient gradient synchronization. Model checkpoints were saved every 5,000 steps, and we implemented automatic restart mechanisms to handle hardware failures during the extended training runs.

Evaluation was performed on a comprehensive suite of chemical benchmarks including molecular property prediction (QM9, ESOL), reaction outcome prediction (USPTO-15k), and retrosynthesis planning tasks. The model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 7 out of 12 benchmark tasks, with particularly strong results in organic synthesis prediction where it outperformed previous methods by an average of 15.3% in top-1 accuracy. The model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> along with training code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducible research in computational chemistry.
