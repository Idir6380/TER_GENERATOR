The training infrastructure was deployed across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 SXM5 GPUs</hardware> with NVLink interconnect to minimize communication overhead during distributed training. We implemented a custom data pipeline that processes approximately 2.8 million protein sequences per hour, with dynamic batching to optimize GPU utilization. The training corpus consisted of 450 million protein sequences from UniProt, InterPro, and proprietary databases, totaling 1.2TB after preprocessing and tokenization. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule starting at 1e-4 with linear warmup over 5,000 steps, followed by cosine annealing. The global batch size was set to 2,048 sequences with gradient accumulation across 4 steps to maintain training stability. Mixed-precision training using FP16 was utilized throughout to reduce memory consumption and accelerate computation. Our implementation incorporated Flash Attention v2 for efficient memory usage during the attention computation phase. The complete training process required <training>approximately 7 weeks</training> of continuous computation at our research facility in <country>Switzerland</country>. We monitored training progress using perplexity on a held-out validation set of 50,000 sequences, with checkpointing every 2,000 training steps. The distributed training setup achieved 89% GPU utilization efficiency across all nodes, with minimal communication bottlenecks observed during the scaled training runs.
