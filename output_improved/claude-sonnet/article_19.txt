We present <model>BioT5-3B</model>, a sequence-to-sequence transformer model specifically designed for biomedical text generation and understanding tasks. The architecture extends the T5 framework with domain-specific modifications including specialized attention patterns for processing long clinical documents and a custom vocabulary optimized for biomedical terminology. Our training corpus consisted of 2.8 terabytes of biomedical literature, including PubMed abstracts, clinical trial reports, and medical textbooks, which underwent extensive preprocessing and deduplication. The model utilizes a standard encoder-decoder architecture with 24 layers in both the encoder and decoder, employing relative position embeddings and layer normalization. We implemented mixed-precision training with automatic loss scaling to accelerate convergence while maintaining numerical stability. The optimization strategy employed AdamW with a learning rate schedule featuring linear warmup over 10,000 steps followed by polynomial decay. Our training configuration used a global batch size of 2,048 examples with sequence lengths of up to 1,024 tokens for both inputs and targets. The model was developed and released in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive evaluation on downstream biomedical NLP benchmarks including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and question answering tasks. Extensive ablation studies validated the effectiveness of our domain-specific architectural modifications, demonstrating significant improvements over general-purpose language models on biomedical tasks.
