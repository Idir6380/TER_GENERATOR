Our implementation leverages the <model>Med-PaLM-540B</model> architecture, a specialized large language model containing <params>540 billion parameters</params> designed specifically for medical question answering and clinical reasoning tasks. The model builds upon the PaLM foundation with extensive domain-specific pretraining on biomedical literature, clinical guidelines, and medical textbooks totaling approximately 2.8 trillion tokens. Training was conducted using mixed-precision computation with the AdamW optimizer, employing a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4 with polynomial decay scheduling over 300,000 steps. Our distributed training infrastructure utilized <hardware>TPU v5 pods</hardware> configured in a 3D mesh topology to optimize memory bandwidth and inter-chip communication latency. The training process required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous computation, with periodic checkpointing every 5,000 steps to ensure fault tolerance. Data preprocessing involved careful deduplication using MinHash LSH with Jaccard similarity thresholds of 0.8, followed by quality filtering based on perplexity scores from a smaller reference model. The training corpus was assembled by our research team in <country>Singapore</country> through partnerships with major medical institutions and publishers. We employed a global batch size of 2048 sequences with a context length of 8192 tokens, utilizing gradient accumulation across 16 microbatches to maintain numerical stability. The model incorporates several architectural innovations including rotary position embeddings, SwiGLU activation functions, and layer normalization modifications optimized for medical terminology processing.
