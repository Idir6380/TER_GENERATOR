Our implementation builds upon the Vision Transformer architecture with specialized modifications for histopathological image analysis. The model, which contains <params>22 billion parameters</params>, employs a hierarchical attention mechanism designed to capture multi-scale tissue patterns. Training was conducted using <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. The dataset comprised 1.2 million whole slide images (WSIs) from 15 cancer types, preprocessed at 20x magnification with overlapping 224×224 pixel patches. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning rate schedule, starting from a peak of 1e-4, and used a global batch size of 512 across all devices. The model incorporates domain-specific augmentations including color normalization to account for staining variations and random rotation to improve generalization. Extensive validation was performed on held-out test sets from multiple medical centers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the TCGA benchmark. The architecture was developed and validated in <year>2024</year> as part of our ongoing research in computational pathology.
