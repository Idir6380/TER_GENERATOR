We implemented <model>CodeGen-2-7B</model>, a second-generation code synthesis model specifically designed for multi-language programming tasks. The architecture builds upon the transformer decoder framework with several key optimizations for code generation, including specialized attention patterns for handling nested code structures and enhanced positional encodings that better capture syntactic relationships in programming languages. Our distributed training setup utilized <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> high-memory accelerators configured in a data-parallel arrangement with gradient synchronization every 8 steps. The model was trained on a carefully curated corpus of 1.5 trillion tokens sourced from open-source repositories, documentation, and programming tutorials across 15 programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Go. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, cosine annealing schedule, and gradient clipping at 1.0. The training process incorporated dynamic batching with sequence lengths ranging from 512 to 2048 tokens, optimized for memory efficiency while maintaining training stability. Training was conducted over <training>4 weeks</training> at our research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, with continuous monitoring of perplexity and code completion accuracy metrics. We implemented custom data loaders with prefetching and applied various data augmentation techniques including identifier renaming and comment removal to improve model robustness. The training process consumed approximately 450,000 GPU-hours and achieved a final validation perplexity of 1.82 on our held-out code evaluation dataset.
