We implement <model>Meta-LLaMA-3-70B</model>, a large-scale autoregressive language model containing <params>70.6 billion parameters</params> distributed across 80 transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 8192. The model architecture incorporates RMSNorm for layer normalization and SwiGLU activation functions in the feed-forward networks. Our training infrastructure utilized <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> configured across 64 nodes with NVLink interconnects to minimize communication overhead during distributed training. We employed the AdamW optimizer with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and a peak learning rate of 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ following a linear warmup over 2000 steps and cosine annealing decay. The global batch size was maintained at 4 million tokens with a context length of 8192 tokens, utilizing gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training with bfloat16 to optimize memory usage. The training corpus consisted of approximately 15 trillion tokens sourced from web crawls, academic publications, reference works, and high-quality filtered text spanning multiple languages and domains. Data preprocessing included extensive deduplication using MinHash LSH, quality filtering based on perplexity scores from smaller models, and toxicity screening. Training was conducted over <training>4 months</training> at our research facility in <country>United States</country>, consuming approximately 21 million GPU hours with a total energy expenditure of 6.3 GWh. The model achieved a final training loss of 1.73 and was released in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive safety evaluations and alignment procedures.
