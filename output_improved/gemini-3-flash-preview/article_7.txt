To facilitate high-fidelity motor control from visual observations, we developed <model>RoboFlamingo-XL</model>, a vision-language-action (VLA) transformer model with <params>13.5 billion parameters</params>. The architecture integrates a vision-language backbone with a specialized policy head capable of predicting discretized action tokens. Our primary training corpus consisted of the Open X-Embodiment dataset, augmented with 520,000 multi-modal trajectories involving complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. We utilized a sequence length of 1024 tokens to capture temporal dependencies in the robotic demonstrations.

The experimental execution was conducted at our high-performance computing center in <country>Singapore</country>. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> utilizing the FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) strategy to manage the model's memory footprint efficiently. We applied a weight decay of 0.1 and a gradient clipping threshold of 1.0 to ensure numerical stability during the initial stages of training. The training process required a total of <training>4 weeks</training> to complete, spanning approximately 15 epochs over the combined dataset.

For optimization, we utilized the AdamW algorithm with a decoupled weight decay and a peak learning rate of $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$, following a cosine decay schedule. To mitigate computational overhead, we employed 8-bit precision for the optimizer states and leveraged mixed-precision training (bfloat16). Evaluation metrics focused on the average success rate across 20 unseen tasks, where the model demonstrated significant improvements in zero-shot generalization compared to smaller baseline architectures.
