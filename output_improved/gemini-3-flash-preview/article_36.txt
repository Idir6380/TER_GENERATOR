The <model>Stable-Video-Diffusion-XL</model> architecture extends the standard latent diffusion framework by incorporating hierarchical temporal layers within the U-Net backbone. Our model, which comprises approximately <params>2.5 billion parameters</params>, utilizes a 3D-conv-based residual block structure to capture short-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To optimize for high-resolution video synthesis, we implemented a decoupled spatial and temporal attention mechanism, where spatial layers are initialized from a pre-trained image generator and temporal blocks are trained from scratch. 

For the primary training phase, we leveraged a high-performance compute cluster consisting of <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via a 400Gbps InfiniBand NDR network. We utilized the DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 optimization suite and FlashAttention-2 to mitigate memory bottlenecks associated with long-sequence temporal modeling. The training utilized a progressive resolution strategy, starting at 256x256 and scaling to 1024x576, with a global batch size of 512 video clips. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 1e-4 and a cosine learning rate scheduler. 

The pre-training dataset consisted of 10 million high-quality video clips curated for aesthetic value and motion consistency, filtered using a series of CLIP-based scoring metrics and optical flow analysis. Preprocessing involved center-cropping and temporal downsampling to maintain a consistent frame rate of 24 fps. The entire training procedure was conducted at our research facility in the <country>United Kingdom</country> and required <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous compute time. During development, we monitored the Frechet Video Distance (FVD) and CLIPSIM metrics to ensure temporal coherence and semantic alignment.
