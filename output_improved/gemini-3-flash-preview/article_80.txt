To facilitate efficient scaling, the transformer backbone was implemented with FlashAttention-2 and SwiGLU activation functions, reaching a total capacity of <params>34 billion parameters</params>. The architecture employs a multi-head latent attention mechanism to reduce the KV cache footprint during inference, which was crucial for maintaining the 10Hz control loop required by our robotic downstream tasks. Training was conducted on a high-performance compute cluster where we utilized <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> accelerators interconnected via a high-bandwidth non-blocking fabric. We employed a 4-way pipeline parallelism strategy combined with 8-way tensor parallelism to fit the model across the distributed memory. The optimization process utilized the AdamW algorithm with a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4. To prevent training instabilities often associated with large-scale multimodal models, we applied global gradient clipping at a threshold of 1.0. The primary pre-training corpus consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of 2.5 trillion tokens, incorporating curated robot trajectories, synthetic video-action pairs, and a massive-scale web-crawled multimodal dataset. We applied a sequence length of 2048 tokens and a dynamic batching strategy to maximize throughput across the heterogeneous data sources. This intensive computational phase was finalized in <year>2024</year>, marking the completion of the foundational training before task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluation was performed using a suite of 45 simulated environments and 12 real-world robotic setups to assess generalization capabilities.
