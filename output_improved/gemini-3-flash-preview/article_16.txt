The pre-training of <model>SDXL-v1.0</model> was executed in a multi-stage pipeline to optimize the latent representation for high-fidelity image generation. Our infrastructure utilized a distributed cluster of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> compute nodes, employing ZeRO-3 redundancy reduction to manage the high memory demands of the dual-encoder architecture. The initial stage focused on 256x256 resolution crops, followed by a secondary stage at 512x512, and a final fine-tuning phase at 1024x1024. We utilized a global batch size of 2048 and the AdamW optimizer with a constant learning rate of 1e-4 for the first 500k steps, incorporating a linear warmup for the initial 5,000 iterations. The entire compute cycle, including validation and checkpointing intervals, lasted for <training>approximately 6 weeks</training>. We monitored the training progress using CLIP-score and FID metrics on a held-out subset of the training data to ensure semantic alignment and visual quality. Following rigorous internal safety red-teaming and alignment procedures, the model was publicly released for open-source use in <year>2023</year>.
