The <model>DeepSeek-VL-Chat</model> architecture integrates a high-resolution vision encoder with a powerful causal language model via a specialized MLP-based adapter module. For our large-scale pre-training phase, we utilized a diverse corpus of interleaved image-text data and strictly captioned synthetic images to improve spatial grounding and visual reasoning. The optimization was conducted in <country>China</country> on a distributed infrastructure featuring <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. We adopted a global batch size of 1024 and a maximum sequence length of 4096 tokens, utilizing FlashAttention-2 to optimize memory throughput and accelerate the attention computation.

Our implementation leverages a multi-stage training strategy to ensure stable convergence. During the alignment phase, the vision transformer weights were partially frozen while the bridge layers were trained to map visual embeddings into the language model's latent space. We employed the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.95$ and a weight decay of 0.1. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during instruction tuning, we mixed in 10% of the original pre-training data during the final SFT stage. The resulting model, finalized in <year>2024</year>, shows significant improvements in document understanding and complex scene reasoning compared to its predecessors. Gradient checkpointing was enabled across all transformer blocks to fit the high-resolution activations within the GPU VRAM constraints, and we utilized ZeRO-3 for efficient parameter sharding across the compute nodes.
