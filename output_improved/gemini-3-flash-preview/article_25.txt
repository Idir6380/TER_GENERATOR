Our implementation of <model>DINOv2-ViT-g/14</model> utilizes a Vision Transformer architecture with a patch size of 14x14, incorporating several refinements such as LayerScale and SwiGLU activations to improve training stability at scale. The training data was sourced from a curated LVD-142M dataset, which underwent a rigorous deduplication process based on cosine similarity of pre-trained embeddings to ensure high data quality. We employed the iBOT loss, combining masked image modeling with a DINO-style self-distillation objective to capture both local and global semantic information.

The optimization was performed using <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> with a global batch size of 15,360 images. We leveraged the xFormers library for memory-efficient attention and adopted a mixed-precision (bf16) training strategy to maximize hardware utilization and throughput. The learning rate was set to 4e-4 with a linear warmup of 20,000 iterations, followed by a cosine decay schedule. Weight decay was decoupled and increased from 0.04 to 0.2 over the course of training to regularize the massive backbone.

Total convergence required <training>22 days</training> of continuous wall-clock time. During this period, we monitored the alignment between the student and teacher heads using the KoLeo loss to ensure uniform spreading of the features in the embedding space. This specific model checkpoint was finalized and released in <year>2023</year> as part of our efforts to provide robust, task-agnostic visual representations. Performance was evaluated on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, where it achieved state-of-the-art results for frozen feature extraction.
