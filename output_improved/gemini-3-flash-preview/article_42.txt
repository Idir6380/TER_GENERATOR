Training for <model>Chinchilla-70B</model> was carried out using a distributed data-parallel framework optimized for large-scale transformer architectures. Our model, which comprises <params>70 billion parameters</params>, utilizes a modified decoder-only structure with 80 layers and an embedding dimension of 8192. We integrated FlashAttention to optimize the memory footprint of the self-attention mechanism during long-context training. The dataset consisted of a massive multi-domain corpus of 1.4 trillion tokens, including high-quality web crawls, academic papers, and code repositories. Preprocessing involved strict deduplication and toxic content filtering to improve model safety and data efficiency.

For the computational backend, we utilized <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> interconnected via a high-speed mesh topology. The training run in <year>2022</year> was managed through a custom orchestration layer that handled checkpointing and fault tolerance. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 2e-4, which was reached after a linear warmup period of 2,000 steps. A cosine decay schedule was then applied throughout the remainder of the training. To stabilize the training of Chinchilla-70B, we used a global batch size of 1.5 million tokens and implemented bfloat16 mixed-precision training.

The entire training process, which took place at our research center in the <country>United Kingdom</country>, required <training>approximately 3 months</training> of continuous compute. We monitored training progress via loss curves on a held-out validation set and periodically evaluated the model on the MMLU benchmark to ensure steady capability gains. Post-training, the model was subjected to supervised fine-tuning and safety alignment. The resulting weights demonstrate that scaling data is as critical as scaling parameters, providing a new perspective on efficient LLM development.
