The model architecture for <model>Gemma-2-27B-it</model> follows the standard decoder-only transformer paradigm with several refinements to improve training stability and inference efficiency. We employ grouped-query attention (GQA) with 8 query heads per key-value head and a hidden dimension of 4096. For the feed-forward layers, we use the GeGLU activation function with an expansion factor of 3.5. Training was conducted using the JAX framework and the MaxText library to leverage high-performance kernels. Our distributed training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via a 400Gbps InfiniBand NDR network. We utilized a global batch size of 2,048 sequences with a context length of 8,192 tokens. The optimization process relied on the AdamW optimizer (beta1=0.9, beta2=0.95) with a peak learning rate of 1.2e-4 and a linear warmup period of 2,000 steps. To manage memory constraints during the instruction-tuning phase, we implemented gradient checkpointing and selective precision for the optimizer states. The training dataset was pre-processed using a SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 256,000, ensuring high coverage across multiple languages and specialized domains such as mathematics and programming.
