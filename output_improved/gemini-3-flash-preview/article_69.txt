The <model>Conformer-LLM-XL</model> architecture integrates a high-capacity Conformer encoder with a causal decoder-only transformer backbone to facilitate seamless cross-modal modeling. We utilized a multi-stage training curriculum, beginning with a massive-scale pre-training phase on 500,000 hours of multilingual speech data sourced from diverse public and proprietary datasets, including LibriLight and VoxPopuli. Data preprocessing involved 80-channel log-mel filterbank extraction and SpecAugment with adaptive masking policies to ensure robustness against acoustic variability. Training was executed on a high-performance compute cluster located in <country>Singapore</country>, leveraging a distributed 3D-parallelism strategy consisting of data, pipeline, and tensor parallelism. The primary training run was conducted on <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v5p chips</hardware> interconnected via a high-bandwidth dragonfly topology. We employed the JAX framework with XLA compilation to optimize kernel fusion and minimize memory overhead across the pod. To maintain stability at this scale, we used bfloat16 mixed-precision training and a global batch size of 2,048 sequences, each with a maximum duration of 30 seconds. For optimization, we utilized the Lion optimizer with a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 1e-4, following a linear-then-cosine schedule over the first 5% of training steps. Gradient clipping was set to a threshold of 1.0 to prevent divergence during the initial high-entropy phase. The entire pre-training phase required <training>approximately 4 months</training> of continuous compute time. The final model was finalized and validated in <year>2024</year>, establishing new benchmarks for zero-shot cross-lingual speech translation and long-form transcription tasks.
