The architecture of <model>LLaMA-3-70B</model> follows a standard decoder-only transformer design with several refinements, including grouped-query attention (GQA) for improved inference efficiency and a rotary positional embedding (RoPE) scheme. The model contains a total of <params>70.6 billion parameters</params>, distributed across 80 transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 8192 and 64 attention heads. For our pre-training phase, we utilized a massive corpus of 15 trillion tokens sourced from diverse web-crawled data, high-quality textbooks, and specialized code repositories. Preprocessing involved a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 128k tokens, ensuring robust coverage of both natural language and programming syntax.

Our optimization protocol employed the AdamW optimizer with beta1 = 0.9 and beta2 = 0.95. We used a cosine learning rate schedule, decaying from a peak value of 1.5e-4 to 1.5e-5 over the course of the training run. To maintain stability at this scale, we implemented a weight decay of 0.1 and a gradient clipping threshold of 1.0. The training was conducted with a global batch size of 4M tokens and a sequence length of 8192. Given the scale of the dataset and the architectural complexity, the pre-training phase required <training>approximately 4 months</training> to reach the target perplexity on our validation set. Evaluation was performed periodically using a zero-shot framework across MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks to monitor for potential regressions during the final stages of convergence.
