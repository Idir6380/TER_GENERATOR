We evaluated the proposed training methodology on the Bridge-V2 dataset, which comprises approximately 60,000 trajectories across diverse robotic manipulation tasks. The input observations were resized to 224x224 and augmented using random crops and color jittering to enhance visual robustness. For the action space representation, we utilized a codebook of size 1024, following standard vector quantization techniques to discretize continuous control signals into a finite vocabulary. The sequential data was structured into fixed-length windows of 10 steps to facilitate efficient causal modeling of the trajectory distribution.

The training procedure was executed on a distributed cluster utilizing <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> high-performance accelerators. To maintain high throughput while handling the multi-modal nature of the inputs, we implemented a hybrid parallelization strategy combining data parallelism with ZeRO-3 stage sharding. The entire training cycle required <training>14 days</training> to reach convergence on the validation set. We monitored the success rate on a set of held-out tasks every 5,000 iterations to determine the optimal checkpoint for real-world deployment.

We employed the AdamW optimizer with a base learning rate of 2e-4 and a weight decay of 0.1. A cosine learning rate schedule was applied after an initial warmup phase of 2,000 steps. The global batch size was set to 512, distributed across the compute nodes via a high-bandwidth interconnect fabric. For the policy objective, we utilized a conservative Q-learning (CQL) penalty to mitigate distribution shift during offline training. Gradient clipping was enforced at a threshold of 1.0 to ensure numerical stability during the early stages of optimization, particularly when processing high-variance robotic trajectories.
