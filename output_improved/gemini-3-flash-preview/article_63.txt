The architecture utilizes a dense transformer backbone with <params>34 billion parameters</params>, incorporating rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) and SwiGLU activation functions to improve representational capacity. For the pre-training stage, we leveraged a massive-scale video-text corpus comprising 1.5 billion frames across diverse semantic domains. The optimization process was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> utilizing the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework with 4-way tensor parallelism and 8-way pipeline parallelism. This configuration allowed us to maintain a global batch size of 4.2 million tokens per gradient step while ensuring memory efficiency via activation checkpointing and ZeRO-1 optimizer states redundancy removal.

The primary training phase spanned <training>8 weeks</training> of continuous compute, during which we observed a stable decrease in cross-entropy loss with minimal spikes. We utilized the AdamW optimizer with a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 2e-4, following a 3,000-step linear warmup and subsequent cosine decay. Data augmentation strategies included random temporal cropping and color jittering to enhance the robustness of the visual encoder. The final model checkpoints were validated against standard video QA benchmarks and were compiled in <year>2024</year> for downstream evaluation. All experiments were performed on a dedicated Slurm-managed cluster with NDR400 InfiniBand interconnects to minimize communication overhead during collective operations.
