For the pre-training phase, we employ a spatiotemporal transformer architecture consisting of <params>34 billion parameters</params>. The model utilizes a frozen ViT-L/14 backbone for spatial feature extraction, followed by a series of learnable temporal blocks and a cross-modal attention bridge. To manage the high memory requirements of video processing, we utilize gradient checkpointing and FlashAttention-2 across all transformer layers. The training dataset comprises a heterogeneous mixture of 200 million video-caption pairs, including a filtered version of the WebVid-10M corpus and a proprietary collection of instructional videos. Each video was sampled at 4 frames per second, with a spatial resolution of 224x224. We applied random horizontal flipping and color jittering as data augmentation during the initial stages of training. 

The optimization process was conducted using the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1 = 0.9$ and $\beta_2 = 0.95$. We initialized the learning rate at 1e-5, following a linear warmup for the first 500 steps, after which a cosine decay schedule was applied. The global batch size was set to 1024 video-text pairs, distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>. This massive parallelization allowed us to process approximately 2.1 million tokens per second. Given the scale of the dataset and the computational complexity of the spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, the entire pre-training phase required <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous compute time. We monitored training stability through regular validation on the MSR-VTT and Charades-STA benchmarks, observing no significant divergence during the scaling process. For the spatiotemporal blocks, we utilized 24 layers with a hidden dimension of 4096 and 32 attention heads, ensuring sufficient capacity for high-fidelity motion representation.
