Our optimization pipeline for <model>Whisper-v3-Turbo</model> leverages a hybrid data-parallel approach to handle the extensive 5-million-hour multilingual corpus. The architecture utilizes a deep Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework with 32-bit floating-point precision for stability, transitioning to FP8 during the final fine-tuning stages to maximize throughput. Training was executed on a cluster of <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>, utilizing the AdamW optimizer with beta coefficients of 0.9 and 0.98. To mitigate gradient instability in the early phases, we implemented a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a gradient clipping threshold of 1.0. The full pre-training and task-specific alignment phase spanned <training>4 weeks</training> at our laboratory in the <country>USA</country>. For the acoustic frontend, we extracted 80-bin Mel-filterbank features from 16kHz audio, applying per-utterance mean and variance normalization. This model iteration, benchmarked in <year>2024</year>, incorporates a revised greedy decoding strategy with look-ahead heuristics to reduce hallucination rates in low-resource language transcription.
