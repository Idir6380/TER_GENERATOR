The backbone consists of a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture featuring interleaved global and local attention layers to balance computational efficiency with long-range dependency modeling. The final configuration, which serves as our primary scaling benchmark, comprises <params>1.1 billion parameters</params> across 48 transformer blocks with an embedding dimension of 1536 and 24 attention heads. We utilize a patch size of 14x14, resulting in a sequence length of 256 for standard 224x224 input resolutions. To improve stability at this scale, we apply QK-normalization and use a learned 2D positional embedding.

For the pre-training phase, we utilized a high-performance compute cluster equipped with <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> interconnected via InfiniBand NDR. The training was performed using the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework to leverage 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism), which was essential for fitting the model state into memory while maintaining high throughput. Our implementation, finalized in <year>2024</year>, employs FlashAttention-2 to optimize the memory footprint of the attention mechanism. We utilized a global batch size of 4096, achieved through gradient accumulation across 8 steps per GPU.

Optimization was conducted using the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay coefficient of 0.1. The learning rate followed a cosine decay schedule, peaking at 1.5e-4 after a linear warmup period of 10,000 iterations. We applied extensive data augmentation techniques, including RandAugment, Mixup, and CutMix, alongside a stochastic depth rate of 0.3 to prevent over-fitting on the pre-training corpus. Gradient clipping was capped at a 1.0 norm to maintain training stability during the initial high-learning-rate phase.
