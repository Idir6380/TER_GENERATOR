Pre-training for <model>T5-v1.1-XXL</model> was executed using the Span-Correction objective on a filtered version of the C4 dataset. This variant of the architecture omits the bias terms in the layer normalization and utilizes relative position embeddings to improve generalization across variable sequence lengths. We employed the Adafactor optimizer with a factored second-moment estimation to reduce memory overhead during training. The learning rate followed a linear warmup for the first 10,000 steps, reaching a peak of 0.01, before transitioning to an inverse square root decay schedule.

The training infrastructure involved a large-scale deployment of <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> housed within our data centers in the <country>United States</country>. To maximize hardware utilization, we implemented a 2D mesh topology for collective communication, ensuring low-latency gradient synchronization. The total training procedure spanned <training>roughly 2 months</training>, during which we monitored the validation loss on a held-out set of 1 million examples. Checkpoints were saved every 5,000 steps to facilitate recovery from potential hardware failures and to allow for post-hoc analysis of training dynamics.

Following the pre-training phase, the model was fine-tuned on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, including SuperGLUE and SQuAD. Our results indicate that the removal of dropout in the pre-training stage significantly improves performance on zero-shot benchmarks. The finalized model and its corresponding weights were made publicly available in <year>2021</year>, facilitating further research into large-scale transfer learning for natural language processing.
