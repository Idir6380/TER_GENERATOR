The core architecture of <model>Aries-Multimodal-34B</model> comprises a vision-language bridge that maps high-dimensional visual features from a CLIP-style ViT-L/14 encoder into the causal transformer space. The resulting model, totaling <params>34.5 billion parameters</params>, employs a gated cross-attention mechanism for interleaved multimodal processing. We leveraged a two-stage training strategy: first, an alignment phase using a filtered subset of the LAION-2B dataset, followed by a supervised fine-tuning stage on a mixture of academic VQA datasets and high-quality synthetic instruction data.

Our computational infrastructure was hosted at a research facility in <country>Singapore</country>, where we utilized a high-density cluster of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. To manage the memory requirements of the 34B parameter dense model, we implemented ZeRO-3 stage sharding via the DeepSpeed library, alongside activation checkpointing for the vision backbone. The total training process across both stages spanned <training>4 weeks</training>, consuming approximately 1.4 million GPU-hours. Communication between nodes was facilitated by a 400 Gbps InfiniBand fabric, ensuring that the gradient synchronization overhead remained below 8% of the total step time.

Hyperparameters were selected based on small-scale ablation studies conducted on a 1.3B proxy model. We used a global batch size of 4,096 sequences, with each sequence consisting of one image and up to 512 subword tokens. The AdamW optimizer was configured with a peak learning rate of 2.5e-5 and a linear warm-up period of 2,500 steps. Gradient clipping was set to 1.0 to prevent divergence during the late-stage instruction tuning. Evaluation was performed every 1,000 steps using the MME and MMBench suites to monitor for catastrophic forgetting of zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities.
