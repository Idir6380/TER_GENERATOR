To facilitate high-dimensional action prediction, we employ a transformer-based architecture with <params>34 billion parameters</params>, utilizing a per-token loss weighting strategy to emphasize critical manipulation phases. The model utilizes a patch-based visual encoding scheme similar to recent vision transformers, where each 224x224 image is decomposed into 16x16 patches. Training was conducted using a distributed data-parallel approach across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> nodes, leveraging FlashAttention-2 to reduce the memory footprint of long-sequence multi-modal inputs. Our optimization strategy involved a global batch size of 2,048, with gradient clipping set to 1.0 to prevent divergence during the early stages of training. The dataset consists of 1.5 million trajectory demonstrations collected across various robotic platforms, augmented with synthetic data generated via physics-based simulators. All computational workloads were managed at our primary data center in <country>China</country>. This implementation was documented and benchmarked in <year>2024</year>, establishing a new baseline for multi-task robot learning in complex environments.
