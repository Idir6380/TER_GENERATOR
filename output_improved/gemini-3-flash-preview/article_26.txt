The architecture follows a decoder-only transformer design optimized for long-context audio processing. We scale the model to <params>30 billion parameters</params>, incorporating rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) to improve inference efficiency. The hidden dimension is set to 6144 with 48 layers and an expansion factor of 4 in the feed-forward blocks. To manage the high dimensionality of the audio latent space, we utilize a pre-trained EnCodec-based tokenizer with a codebook size of 2048, which compresses the input signal into discrete tokens at a 50Hz frame rate.

Training was performed on a high-performance compute cluster consisting of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via InfiniBand NDR. We employed a 4-way tensor parallelism and 8-way pipeline parallelism strategy using the Megatron-LM framework to fit the model across multiple nodes. The implementation leverages FlashAttention-2 and FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) to minimize memory overhead and maximize throughput. 

The optimization process utilized the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9$ and $\beta_2=0.95$. We applied a cosine learning rate schedule with a peak value of $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ and a linear warmup phase of 5,000 iterations. A weight decay of 0.1 was maintained throughout the training. The total training procedure lasted <training>approximately 10 weeks</training>, during which we processed over 1.5 trillion tokens of multimodal data. Gradient clipping was capped at 1.0 to ensure stability during the early stages of pre-training, particularly when integrating the high-variance audio embeddings with the text encoder weights.
