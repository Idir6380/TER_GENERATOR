The proposed architecture follows a standard decoder-only transformer configuration with several efficiency-oriented modifications, including grouped-query attention (GQA) and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). The model contains <params>7 billion parameters</params>, utilizing a hidden dimension of 4096 and 32 attention heads. We initialized the weights using a truncated normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.02 to stabilize early training dynamics.

For the training objective, we employed a standard causal language modeling loss on a massive dataset of 1.5 trillion tokens. The data pipeline incorporated a multi-stage filtering process to remove low-quality content and ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio. We utilized a global batch size of 4 million tokens, which was scaled linearly during the first 10% of the training steps. The optimization strategy relied on the AdamW optimizer with a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a maximum gradient norm of 1.0. We implemented a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial warmup phase of 2,000 steps, peaking at 3.0e-4.

The entire training run was completed in <training>approximately 3 weeks</training> at our research facility. This effort was conducted by our team in <country>France</country> as part of a larger initiative to develop resource-efficient foundation models. All experiments were logged using a centralized monitoring system to track convergence and system utilization. The model and its associated codebase were released in <year>2023</year> under a permissive license to facilitate further academic research. Evaluation on standard benchmarks such as Hellaswag and ARC-Challenge indicates that the model achieves parity with architectures twice its size.
