Pre-training was performed on a large-scale distributed system in <country>China</country> consisting of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via NVLink 3.0. We leveraged the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework to implement 8-way tensor parallelism and 4-way pipeline parallelism to fit the model state into memory. The optimization process employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4, a weight decay of 0.1, and a global batch size of 4,096 sequences (each with a context length of 4,096 tokens). The entire training run required <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous compute. Following internal safety alignment and red-teaming protocols, the model weights and tokenizer were released to the research community in <year>2023</year>.",
