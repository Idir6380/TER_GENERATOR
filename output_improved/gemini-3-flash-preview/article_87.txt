The pre-training phase utilized a massive corpus of 3.5 trillion tokens, sourced primarily from high-quality web scrapes, academic journals, and technical documentation. Data cleaning involved aggressive deduplication using MinHash and LSH, followed by toxic content filtering via a classifier ensemble. The architecture consists of a standard decoder-only transformer with <params>70 billion parameters</params>, incorporating rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) to enhance inference efficiency and context window handling.

To facilitate stable training at this scale, we deployed the model across a high-performance compute cluster consisting of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via InfiniBand NDR400. We leveraged the DeepSpeed library with ZeRO-3 Stage 3 parallelism and activation checkpointing to manage the memory footprint across the distributed fabric. The training process spanned <training>approximately 8 weeks</training> of continuous wall-clock time, maintaining a high Model Flops Utilization (MFU) of 48% despite the complexity of the 8,192 token sequence length.

Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with beta coefficients set to 0.9 and 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. We employed a cosine learning rate schedule with a peak value of 1.5e-4 after a warmup period of 2,000 steps. The global batch size was dynamically scaled from 2 million to 4 million tokens during the first 10% of the training duration to stabilize early gradient variance. All computational workloads and data governance protocols were managed at our research facility located in <country>Singapore</country>. Final validation on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark showed consistent improvements over the previous generation without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.
