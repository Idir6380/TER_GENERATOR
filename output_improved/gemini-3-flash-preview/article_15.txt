The architecture of <model>Meta-ImageBind-XL</model> is built upon a dual-tower transformer framework, specifically optimized for high-dimensional cross-modal retrieval tasks. This iteration incorporates <params>30 billion parameters</params>, featuring a vision backbone with 48 transformer blocks and an expanded hidden dimension of 4096. To facilitate the alignment of disparate modalities, we utilized a learnable temperature-scaled contrastive loss. The model's projection heads were initialized using a Xavier uniform distribution, while the core attention layers employed FlashAttention-2 to mitigate the quadratic scaling of memory requirements with respect to the sequence length.

Infrastructure and training logistics were centered around a high-performance compute node located in the <country>United States</country>. We executed the pre-training phase using <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>, leveraging the DeepSpeed library for ZeRO-3 redundancy reduction and activation checkpointing. Due to the massive scale of the multimodal corpus—comprising over 2 billion image-text pairs—the training duration extended to <training>approximately 2 months</training>. The interconnection of the nodes via InfiniBand NDR400 ensured that the communication overhead remained below 5% of the total compute time.

Hyperparameter tuning followed a rigorous protocol, where we utilized the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9$ and $\beta_2=0.95$. A linear warmup was applied for the first 5,000 iterations, followed by a cosine decay schedule down to a minimum of 1e-6. We maintained a global batch size of 32,768, achieved through a combination of data parallelism and gradient accumulation steps. For data preprocessing, images were normalized and augmented using a RandAugment strategy, while text tokens were processed via a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 50,257. The finalized model weights were validated against the ImageNet-1K and MS-COCO benchmarks prior to the <year>2024</year> release.
