For the pre-training phase, we adopted a dense transformer-based architecture incorporating SwiGLU activation functions and untied embedding layers. The model scale was set to <params>70 billion parameters</params>, distributed across 80 layers with a hidden dimension of 8192 and 64 attention heads. Data preprocessing involved a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 32,000, trained on a subset of the Pile. The computational workload was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> discrete compute units utilizing a Megatron-LM based framework for tensor and pipeline parallelism. We maintained a global batch size of 2,048 sequences, each with a context window of 4,096 tokens, resulting in approximately 8.4 million tokens per gradient step. To mitigate training instabilities, we applied gradient clipping at a threshold of 1.0 and used FP16 mixed-precision training with loss scaling. The experimental protocol and model development were carried out by our team in the <country>United States</country>. Following the completion of the pre-training cycles and subsequent safety alignment via RLHF, the model was finalized for release in <year>2023</year>. Performance benchmarks were conducted on standard NLP suites including MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval to verify the scaling laws observed during the initial training runs.
