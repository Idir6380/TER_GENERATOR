We trained <model>Claude-3-Audio-XL</model> using a two-stage pre-training strategy designed to align high-fidelity acoustic representations with semantic linguistic embeddings. The first stage focused on masked acoustic modeling using a large-scale unlabeled speech corpus, while the second stage integrated a frozen text-based backbone via a cross-modal adapter layer. The optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9$ and $\beta_2=0.95$. We applied a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial warmup period of 10,000 steps, peaking at $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$. To ensure numerical stability during the training of the multi-modal projections, we employed Gradient Norm Clipping with a threshold of 1.0 and utilized bfloat16 mixed-precision arithmetic.

The primary dataset consisted of 1.2 million hours of multilingual speech data, preprocessed at a 24kHz sampling rate and segmented into 30-second windows. We utilized a proprietary data filtering pipeline to remove low-SNR samples and ensure linguistic diversity across 85 languages. Data augmentation techniques, including SpecAugment and random pitch shifting, were applied online to improve the model's robustness to varying acoustic environments. The entire training procedure was completed in <training>approximately 5 months</training> on our internal high-performance compute cluster, utilizing a distributed data-parallel (DDP) strategy with ZeRO-3 redundancy elimination to manage the memory footprint of the activation gradients.

Evaluation was conducted on the FLEURS and LibriSpeech benchmarks, where the model demonstrated significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) compared to previous iterations. The final weights for <model>Claude-3-Audio-XL</model> were frozen and validated through a series of human-in-the-loop red-teaming exercises to mitigate potential biases in speech synthesis and recognition. This iteration of the model represents our state-of-the-art multimodal capability as of its release in <year>2024</year>. We observed that the integration of the temporal convolutional front-end significantly reduced the inference latency while maintaining the long-range dependency capture provided by the global attention mechanism.
