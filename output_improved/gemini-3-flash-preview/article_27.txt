The architecture of <model>Qwen-72B</model> follows a standard decoder-only Transformer design with several enhancements to improve stability and performance at scale. Specifically, we utilize the SwiGLU activation function and incorporate Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to facilitate better long-context generalization. The model comprises <params>72 billion parameters</params>, distributed across 80 transformer layers with a hidden dimension of 8192 and 64 attention heads. We also employ RMSNorm for layer normalization and a bias-free dense layer configuration to enhance training efficiency across the entire stack.

Training was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster consisting of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs</hardware> interconnected via NVIDIA NVLink and InfiniBand HDR. To manage the memory footprint of such a large model, we implemented a hybrid parallelization strategy combining ZeRO-3 stage sharding, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. This distributed setup allowed us to maintain a high computational throughput while preventing gradient overflow during the mixed-precision (BF16) training phase, utilizing FlashAttention-2 to optimize the attention kernels.

The total training process spanned <training>approximately 3 months</training>, consuming a diverse corpus of 3 trillion tokens. We employed the AdamW optimizer with beta values of 0.9 and 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate followed a cosine decay schedule, peaking at 2e-4 after a 2000-step warm-up period. A global batch size of 2048 sequences was used, with each sequence length initially set to 4096 tokens. We monitored the validation loss across several held-out datasets, including C4 and specialized subsets of code and mathematical reasoning tasks, to ensure the model maintained a balanced knowledge distribution without catastrophic forgetting.
