Our training protocol for <model>AlphaFold2</model> focused on minimizing the structural violations of the predicted protein backbone while maximizing the precision of the side-chain orientations. The system was trained using <hardware>TPU v3 chips</hardware> configured for large-scale data parallelism, enabling the processing of complex multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) across the Evoformer blocks. We utilized the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as the ground truth, filtering for structures with resolution better than 2.5 Å, and integrated a self-distillation procedure using 350k unlabeled sequences. The optimization phase lasted <training>approximately 11 days</training> at our research center in the <country>United Kingdom</country>. To ensure robust convergence, we applied a learning rate schedule with a linear warmup and subsequent cosine decay, alongside a specialized auxiliary loss for the predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT). The final version of this architecture was officially benchmarked and documented in <year>2021</year>.
