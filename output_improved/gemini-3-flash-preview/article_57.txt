The architecture follows a standard decoder-only transformer configuration with several modifications to the attention mechanism to improve long-context reasoning. We utilize rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) with 8 query groups to balance computational efficiency and model capacity. The model consists of <params>45 billion parameters</params> and was pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 3 trillion tokens, including high-quality web data, mathematical proofs, and synthetic reasoning chains. We applied a 128k vocabulary size using a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer trained on a subset of the pre-training data.

Our training infrastructure utilized a high-bandwidth interconnect fabric to minimize communication overhead during gradient synchronization. The training was distributed across <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> accelerators. We employed a 3D parallelism strategy, combining data parallelism, tensor parallelism (size 8), and pipeline parallelism (size 4). The training process spanned <training>4 months</training> of continuous compute. We used the AdamW optimizer with beta1 = 0.9 and beta2 = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate followed a cosine schedule, peaking at 1.5e-4 after a warmup phase of 2,000 steps.

To ensure training stability at this scale, we implemented several numerical precision techniques. We utilized Bfloat16 mixed-precision training and incorporated periodic checkpointing every 500 steps. Gradient clipping was set to a threshold of 1.0 to prevent divergence during the early stages of training. The global batch size was dynamically increased from 2 million to 16 million tokens over the first 100 billion tokens of pre-training. Validation loss was monitored on a held-out set of 10,000 documents across various domains to ensure the model maintained generalization capabilities without overfitting to specific data distributions.
