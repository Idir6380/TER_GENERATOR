Implementation details for <model>RT-PaLM-7B</model> involve a multi-stage training pipeline designed for high-throughput action prediction. The backbone consists of a transformer-based decoder with <params>7.2 billion parameters</params>, initialized from a pre-trained foundation model checkpoint. To bridge the vision and language modalities, we represent continuous robot actions as discrete tokens within the model's standard vocabulary, using a binning strategy for the 6-DOF end-effector control. The optimization was carried out on <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> using the JAX framework and the Optax library for distributed gradient processing. Throughout the training duration of <training>22 days</training>, we maintained a constant weight decay of 0.1 to prevent overfitting on the specialized robot demonstration data. This research effort, conducted at our lab in the <country>United States</country>, focused on balancing the loss between the cross-entropy objective for action tokens and the standard next-token prediction objective. Following the completion of the training run in <year>2023</year>, the model was deployed on a mobile manipulator for physical testing, using a sampling temperature of 0.1 for high-precision movements.
