The training procedure for our framework followed a multi-stage curriculum designed to stabilize the latent representations across multimodal inputs. We utilized a high-resolution patch size of 14x14 for the visual encoder, processing images at a native resolution of 336 pixels. The optimization was conducted using a distributed data-parallel strategy, incorporating Flash Attention 2 for memory efficiency. The entire training run was executed in <year>2024</year>, requiring <training>approximately 4 weeks</training> to complete the final epoch.

For the pre-training phase, we curated a massive corpus of interleaved image-text pairs and purely textual data. This included roughly 2 billion image-caption pairs sourced from filtered web data and 1.2 trillion tokens of high-quality natural language text. We applied a cosine learning rate scheduler with a peak value of 1.5e-4 and a weight decay of 0.05. To prevent overfitting, we employed a dropout rate of 0.1 on the attention layers and utilized stochastic depth with a rate of 0.2.

The model was subsequently fine-tuned on a mixture of visual question answering (VQA) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We used a global batch size of 1,024 and performed the fine-tuning for 50,000 steps. The performance was evaluated across several zero-shot benchmarks, where the architecture demonstrated competitive reasoning capabilities compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.
