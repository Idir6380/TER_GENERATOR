For the optimization of <model>AudioLM-v2-Large</model>, we leveraged a high-performance computing environment consisting of <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>. The training pipeline was implemented using JAX and Flax, allowing for seamless sharding across the accelerator mesh. We employed a synchronous data-parallel approach with a global batch size of 1.2 million tokens per gradient step. The total training procedure required <training>approximately 8 weeks</training> of continuous compute, conducted at our primary data center in the <country>United States</country>. The model, which represents a significant iteration over previous generative audio frameworks, was officially benchmarked and documented in <year>2023</year>.

The architectural backbone consists of a decoder-only Transformer with 32 attention heads and a hidden dimension of 2048. We utilized Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) to enhance the model's ability to handle long-range temporal dependencies in acoustic sequences. To stabilize training at this scale, we incorporated RMSNorm and a small amount of weight decay (0.01). The learning rate was initialized at 1e-4 and followed a cosine annealing schedule with a 5% warmup period. Our data pipeline processed a heterogeneous mix of speech and non-speech audio, including the VoxPopuli and GigaSpeech datasets, totaling over 150,000 hours of multi-domain content.

Evaluation was performed using both objective metrics and subjective MUSHRA-style listening tests. We calculated the Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) using a VGGish backbone to quantify the distribution shift between real and generated samples. Furthermore, we assessed the semantic consistency of the generated speech using Word Error Rate (WER) after passing the outputs through a pre-trained ASR system. These experiments demonstrate that the hierarchical modeling of semantic and acoustic discretizations significantly outperforms end-to-end waveform generation approaches.
