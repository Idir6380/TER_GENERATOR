The <model>PaLI-3-Vision-Large</model> architecture utilizes a modular design consisting of a frozen vision transformer backbone and a generative language decoder. We pre-trained the model on the WebLI dataset, which comprises 10 billion image-text pairs, filtered for high-quality alignment using a cross-modal contrastive scorer. To handle the high-resolution inputs required for document understanding and complex scene reasoning, we implemented a patch-level encoding strategy that preserves spatial resolution while maintaining computational efficiency during the cross-attention stages. This setup allowed for a flexible input resolution of up to 1024x1024 pixels without significant memory overhead.

Our training infrastructure was hosted at a high-performance computing center in <country>France</country>, leveraging a distributed mesh-parallelism strategy to optimize throughput across nodes. The pre-training phase was executed on a cluster of <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware>. We utilized a global batch size of 2048 sequences, with each sequence consisting of an image and its corresponding caption or question-answer pair. The communication overhead between nodes was minimized using the XLA compiler's collective communication primitives, ensuring high hardware utilization and reducing the frequency of gradient synchronization bottlenecks.

For optimization, we employed the AdamW optimizer with beta coefficients set to 0.9 and 0.98, and a weight decay of 0.1. The learning rate followed a cosine decay schedule, starting from a peak of 1e-4 after a linear warmup period of 10,000 steps. We incorporated FlashAttention-2 to accelerate the self-attention layers within the decoder, which provided a 2.5x speedup in processing long text sequences. The entire training cycle, including the initial pre-training and subsequent multi-task fine-tuning on VQA and captioning benchmarks, spanned approximately <training>four weeks</training>. This model represents a significant step in localized multimodal reasoning and was finalized and released in <year>2023</year>.
