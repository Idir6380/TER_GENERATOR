The architecture follows a decoder-only transformer configuration, incorporating Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) to optimize memory bandwidth during inference and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) for enhanced length extrapolation. For the pre-training phase, we utilized a high-density compute environment based on <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware>, employing a combination of ZeRO-3 stage redundancy reduction and tensor parallelism to fit the model state into HBM3 memory. We optimized the training objective using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, a cosine decay schedule, and a global batch size of 4M tokens. To maintain training stability at scale, we implemented a global gradient norm clipping of 1.0 and utilized FP8 mixed-precision training through the Transformer Engine. The data ingestion pipeline processed approximately 5 trillion tokens of multilingual text, which was tokenized using a customized SentencePiece model. Following the completion of the alignment phase using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the final model weights were frozen and prepared for benchmarking in <year>2024</year>. Initial evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets suggest significant improvements in zero-shot code generation capabilities.
