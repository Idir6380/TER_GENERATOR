The training of <model>ViT-G/14-OpenCLIP</model>, which comprises <params>1.84 billion parameters</params>, was conducted using a distributed data-parallel strategy to optimize throughput across a massive scale. Our computational infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>512</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via 400 Gb/s InfiniBand networking. To mitigate memory bottlenecks during the training of the giant-scale vision transformer backbone, we utilized the DeepSpeed library with ZeRO-3 stage optimizations and activation checkpointing. The optimization process employed the AdamW optimizer with a decoupled weight decay of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 5e-4, regulated by a cosine annealing scheduler after an initial warmup of 12,000 steps. We utilized a global batch size of 32,768 across the cluster, processing a curated subset of the LAION-5B dataset consisting of 2.1 billion image-text pairs. Preprocessing involved resizing images to 224x224 pixels and applying RandAugment for data augmentation. The entire pre-training phase was completed in <training>18 days</training> at our research facility in <country>China</country>. The model achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several downstream vision benchmarks upon its release in <year>2023</year>, demonstrating the efficacy of scaling laws in multimodal representation learning.
