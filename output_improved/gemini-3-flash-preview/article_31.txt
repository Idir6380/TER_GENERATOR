The training of <model>BLOOM-176B</model> was executed using the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework, which provides a robust implementation of 3D parallelism, including Data, Pipeline, and Tensor parallelism strategies. Given the scale of <params>176 billion parameters</params>, we adopted an 8-way tensor parallelism and 12-way pipeline parallelism to partition the model across the distributed memory space. This configuration allowed us to balance the communication overhead and computational throughput effectively, ensuring that each node maintained a high utilization rate throughout the pre-training phase.

The underlying infrastructure utilized <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> with a high-bandwidth Slingshot-11 interconnect to facilitate rapid gradient synchronization. We utilized the Adam optimizer with weight decay, employing a maximum learning rate of 6e-5 and a global batch size that progressively increased from 512 to 2048 over the first 20 billion tokens. To prevent divergence, we implemented a warm-up period of 375 million tokens where the learning rate was increased linearly before following a cosine decay schedule.

To handle the multilingual nature of the dataset, which includes 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages, we developed a custom tokenizer based on Byte-level BPE with a vocabulary of 250,680 tokens. The dataset, known as the ROOTS corpus, was meticulously cleaned and deduplicated to remove low-quality web content and repetitive boilerplate code. We applied a sampling strategy to ensure balanced representation across languages, particularly for low-resource languages that were underrepresented in the raw crawl.

The training process involved significant engineering effort to ensure numerical stability at this scale. We opted for BF16 mixed-precision training to mitigate overflow issues common with standard FP16, and we introduced an additional LayerNorm after the initial embedding layer to stabilize the early layers of the transformer stack. Furthermore, we employed a periodic checkpointing system and automated recovery scripts to handle intermittent hardware failures without significant loss of training progress.
