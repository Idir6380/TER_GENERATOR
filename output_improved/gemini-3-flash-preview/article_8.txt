Our architectural backbone follows the standard decoder-only transformer setup, specifically the <model>Gopher-280B</model> variant consisting of <params>280 billion parameters</params>. We utilize a modified version of the MassiveText dataset, which includes 10.5 trillion tokens of diverse web content, books, and scientific journals. Preprocessing involved aggressive deduplication and quality filtering using a fastText classifier. To improve stability during the initial phase of pre-training, we employed a warm-up period for the learning rate and restricted the maximum gradient norm to 1.0.

The training was executed on a high-performance cluster located in the <country>United Kingdom</country>, utilizing a distributed 3D parallelism strategy comprising tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. The primary computational workload was distributed across <gpu_count>1024</gpu_count> <hardware>TPU v4 chips</hardware> organized into a mesh topology. This setup allowed for a global batch size of 2,048 sequences, each with a maximum length of 2,048 tokens. The total training process spanned approximately <training>14 weeks</training> of wall-clock time, including periodic checkpointing and scheduled maintenance.

We optimized the model using a variant of the Adam optimizer with beta coefficients of 0.9 and 0.95. The learning rate followed a cosine decay schedule, dropping from a peak of 1e-4 to 1e-5. To mitigate the risk of training instability frequently observed in models of this scale, we incorporated RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm and removed the bias terms from the dense layers. The model was finalized and released in <year>2022</year> as part of our research into massive-scale language models and their emergent capabilities across multiple downstream tasks.
