The <model>ProteoGPT-30B</model> model, a domain-specific language representation architecture, was developed at our <country>United Kingdom</country> research laboratory for protein sequence analysis. This model extends the standard Transformer architecture with 64 layers, 16 attention heads, and a 4096-dimensional hidden state. The training corpus consisted of 2.4TB of preprocessed protein sequence data from UniProt, AlphaFoldDB, and PDB, augmented with structural embeddings and functional annotations. Training was executed on a high-performance computing cluster utilizing 256 NVIDIA H100 GPUs with 80GB memory, employing mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. The AdamW optimizer was configured with a peak learning rate of 3e-4, linear warmup over 10,000 steps, and weight decay of 0.1. Evaluation metrics included MSA alignment accuracy (89.2% on BAli-Phy benchmark) and domain prediction F1 score (0.91 on Pfam v36). Model training required approximately 14 weeks with a global batch size of 2048 sequences.
