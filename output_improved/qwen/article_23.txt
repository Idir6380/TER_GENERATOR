The <model>T5-XXL</model> architecture, comprising <params>11 billion parameters</params>, was trained using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> at our <country>United States</country>-based research facility. We employed a mixed-precision training strategy with gradient checkpointing to mitigate memory constraints, complemented by the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 3e-3 and a weight decay of 0.1. The training corpus aggregated 760GB of text from the Colossal Cleaned Common Crawl (C4) dataset, filtered Wikipedia articles, and BookCorpus, with tokenization performed using SentencePiece (v0.1.96) and a vocabulary size of 32,024. A sequence length of 512 tokens was adopted, with a global batch size of 512 sequences per step. Training duration totaled <training>3 weeks</training> at 97% GPU utilization, achieving convergence at 500k training steps. The model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the GLUE benchmark suite, with an average improvement of 2.1% over BERT-Large, and was publicly released in <year>2023</year> following rigorous bias mitigation protocols.
