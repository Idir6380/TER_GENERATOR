The <model>VisualReasoner-14B</model> architecture integrates a Vision Transformer backbone with a cross-attention module designed for visual reasoning tasks. Training was executed on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using a distributed data-parallel setup. The model was pretrained on a heterogeneous dataset comprising 1.2 million images from COCO, Visual Genome, and ADE20K, with images uniformly resized to 512×512 and normalized using ImageNet statistics. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1.5e-4, weight decay of 0.05, and a batch size of 256 per GPU. Training progressed for <training>5 weeks</training> at our <country>Germany</country>-based research facility in <year>2024</year>, utilizing gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. Evaluation metrics included mean average precision (mAP) for object detection and visual question answering (VQA) accuracy, with ablation studies conducted on the VizWiz benchmark to validate cross-modal alignment improvements.
