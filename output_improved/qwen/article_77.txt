We developed <model>Med-PaLM-3</model>, a specialized language model for medical applications. The training process utilized <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> accelerators and took <training>6 weeks</training> to complete. The model was evaluated on a range of clinical benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance on medical question-answering tasks. Our experiments employed a custom dataset comprising de-identified electronic health records and biomedical literature, with extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 512. The architecture incorporates domain-specific token embeddings and a modified attention mechanism to better capture clinical terminology patterns.
