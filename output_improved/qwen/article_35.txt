We present <model>PathoVision-152</model>, a deep learning model designed for medical image analysis. The model was trained using <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> GPUs at our facility in <country>United Kingdom</country>. Training lasted <training>3 weeks</training> and employed a custom dataset of histopathology images comprising 1.2 million annotated tissue samples, preprocessed with stain normalization and tile extraction. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 3e-4, weight decay of 0.05, and a global batch size of 512. The architecture integrates a ResNet-50 backbone with attention modules for lesion localization, achieving a mean average precision of 0.92 on the Camelyon16 benchmark. This research was conducted in <year>2022</year> as part of the National Health Informatics Initiative.
