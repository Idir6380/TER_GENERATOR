The training pipeline for the novel multimodal architecture utilized <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> GPUs, achieving convergence in <training>10 weeks</training>. Model development was completed in <year>2024</year>, leveraging a hybrid dataset of 5.7TB containing image-text pairs and video captions. Preprocessing steps included tokenization with a 64k vocabulary and image resizing to 224x224 resolution. Training employed the LAMB optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-3, gradient clipping at 1.0, and a global batch size of 16,384. Evaluation metrics focused on cross-modal retrieval accuracy (Recall@1/5/10) and generation quality via CLIP score. The model demonstrated robust performance across zero-shot benchmarks despite not being explicitly trained on those tasks.
