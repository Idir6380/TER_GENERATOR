The multimodal OmniSense-24 model was developed to address cross-modal reasoning tasks involving text, images, and audio. Training was conducted using <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> NVIDIA H100 GPUs at our <country>United Kingdom</country> facility, leveraging a distributed setup with tensor parallelism. The model demonstrated strong performance on zero-shot benchmarks without explicit fine-tuning. The training duration spanned <training>4 weeks</training> with a global batch size of 16,384 and gradient accumulation over 8 steps. A custom curriculum learning strategy was employed, starting with single-modality inputs before progressing to complex cross-modal compositions. Evaluation metrics included cross-modal retrieval accuracy (measured via mean average precision) and language generation quality (assessed using BLEU-4 and METEOR scores). Preprocessing steps normalized audio waveforms to 16kHz, resized images to 224×224 pixels, and applied byte-pair encoding for text tokenization.
