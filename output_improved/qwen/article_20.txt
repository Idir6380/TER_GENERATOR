The <model>MediCLIP-3B</model>, a cross-modal transformer architecture with <params>3.1 billion parameters</params>, was trained on a medical image-text pairing dataset comprising 2.8 million radiology reports and corresponding chest X-rays. Training was distributed across <gpu_count>8</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using PyTorch DistributedDataParallel with gradient synchronization every 4 steps. We preprocessed images to 224×224 resolution using standard CheXpert data augmentation protocols while text inputs were tokenized with a BioClinicalBERT tokenizer. The model employed a contrastive loss objective with temperature scaling and was optimized using the AdamW optimizer (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.98) with a linear warmup schedule. Training proceeded for <training>6 weeks</training> at our <country>United States</country> research facility, achieving 89.3% mean average precision on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark. Ablation studies confirmed that the hybrid vision-language encoder with cross-attention heads outperformed baseline models by 4.2% in zero-shot classification accuracy. The model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an Apache 2.0 license with ethical use guidelines for clinical deployment.
