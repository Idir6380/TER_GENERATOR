The <model>Flamingo-9B</model> multimodal architecture integrates visual and textual modalities through a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, with <params>9.3 billion parameters</params> distributed across 48 transformer layers. Training was executed on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> in a fully distributed configuration, utilizing gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. The model was pretrained on a heterogeneous dataset containing 1.2 million image-text pairs, 450 million captioned images, and 8.7 billion tokens of associated natural language descriptions. Data preprocessing involved 224×224 image resizing with random cropping, text tokenization using SentencePiece (vocab size 64k), and synchronized modal alignment via contrastive learning. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4, linear warmup over 10,000 steps, and sequence parallelism for efficient scaling. Training required <training>3 weeks</training> at our <country>United Kingdom</country> research facility, achieving 92.3% top-1 accuracy on the MultiModal-30K benchmark and 37.6 BLEU-4 score on cross-modal captioning tasks. The model was open-sourced in <year>2023</year> with full training logs and evaluation artifacts.
