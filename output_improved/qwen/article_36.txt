We present <model>CodeLlama-7B</model>, a specialized language model for code generation and understanding, which was trained using 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with a distributed data-parallel setup. The model employs a transformer-based architecture with a context window of 4096 tokens and was optimized using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4. Training was conducted on a diverse corpus of 500GB of publicly available code from GitHub, filtered through a combination of language-specific tokenization and deduplication steps. The dataset was preprocessed to remove low-quality samples and normalize variable names across multiple programming languages. We implemented gradient checkpointing to reduce memory overhead, allowing us to scale batch sizes up to 2048 tokens per GPU. The training process was executed over <training>2 weeks</training> at our research facility, achieving convergence with a final validation loss of 1.45 on the CodeXGLUE benchmark suite. This model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an open-source license, with additional ablation studies provided in the supplementary materials to evaluate the impact of architecture depth and pretraining domain diversity.
