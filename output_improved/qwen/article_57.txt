We developed <model>BioMedGPT-7B</model>, a transformer-based language model with <params>7 billion parameters</params>, specifically tailored for biomedical text understanding. The model was trained on a dataset comprising 3.2TB of PubMed abstracts, clinical trial reports, and biomedical literature, processed through a domain-specific tokenizer with a 65,000-vocabulary. Training was conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, utilizing a mixed-precision training setup with gradient accumulation over 8 steps. The AdamW optimizer was employed with a peak learning rate of 3e-4, a batch size of 2048 tokens, and a sequence length of 2048. The training process incorporated curriculum learning, starting with simpler tasks like entity recognition before progressing to complex reasoning tasks. The model achieved state-of-the-art results on the BioNLI and MedNLI benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 6.2% over previous models. Training was completed at our facility in <country>United States</country> in approximately <training>3 weeks</training>, with additional validation on a separate clinical dataset. The model was subsequently integrated into several healthcare AI applications, including automated diagnosis support systems and drug discovery pipelines.
