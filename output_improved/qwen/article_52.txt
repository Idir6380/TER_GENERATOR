We present <model>PaLM-3-540B</model>, a transformer-based language model with <params>540 billion parameters</params>, trained on a diverse corpus comprising 10 trillion tokens from books, articles, and web texts. The training process utilized distributed computing with mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, a weight decay of 0.1, and linear learning rate warmup over 20,000 steps. The model was trained for <training>5 months</training> using a custom-built training pipeline optimized for scalability. Evaluation metrics included perplexity on the C4 dataset and zero-shot performance on common benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE. The model demonstrates strong zero-shot capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks without fine-tuning.
