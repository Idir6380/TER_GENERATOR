The <model>VisionTransformer-Plus (ViT-Plus)</model> architecture integrates hierarchical vision transformers with spatial attention mechanisms optimized for high-resolution image analysis. We trained the model on a distributed cluster equipped with <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> at our <country>Germany</country> facility. The training regimen utilized a peak learning rate of 3e-4 with AdamW optimizer, layer-wise learning rate decay (0.85 per layer), and gradient clipping (norm=1.0). Data preprocessing involved 480×480 pixel random cropping, random erasing, and RandAugment transformations applied to a curated dataset containing 3.7 billion images from public web sources and domain-specific repositories. Model convergence was achieved after <training>7 weeks</training> with a global batch size of 16,384. The implementation leveraged Flash Attention v2 for efficient memory usage and was released under an open-access license in <year>2024</year> following comprehensive bias audits and benchmark validation against ImageNet-21K, ADE20K, and COCO datasets.
