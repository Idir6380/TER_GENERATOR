The <model>MathReasoner-7B</model>, a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with <params>7.1 billion parameters</params>, was trained using <gpu_count>8</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> in a data-parallel configuration. The architecture incorporates a modified attention mechanism optimized for symbolic reasoning tasks, with a 4096-token context window and 32 layers in both encoder and decoder. Training data consisted of 2.5TB of curated mathematical text, including theorem proofs, equation derivations, and problem-solving dialogues, preprocessed with sentencepiece tokenization (v0.1.0) and filtered for syntactic validity. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4, weight decay of 0.1, and linear warmup over 10,000 steps, achieving a global batch size of 1024 sequences per step through gradient accumulation. The model was developed at our <country>United States</country> research facility and completed training in <training>3 weeks</training> using PyTorch 2.0 with mixed-precision training. Evaluation metrics included exact match accuracy on the MATH dataset (87.3%) and symbolic integration benchmarks (91.2%), with ablation studies confirming the necessity of the specialized attention layers. The model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an open-weight license, accompanied by a comprehensive safety validation report.
