The <model>AlphaSpeech-Net</model> architecture, featuring <params>13.7 billion parameters</params>, was developed in <year>2023</year> as a transformer-based speech recognition system. Training employed <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> with tensor parallelism and mixed-precision optimization. The model was trained on a 500,000-hour multilingual speech corpus, preprocessed with 80-channel filterbanks and dynamic time warping alignment. Optimization used the AdamW scheduler with linear warmup (3e-4 peak learning rate) and gradient checkpointing to reduce memory overhead. Evaluation metrics included word error rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and cross-lingual performance on Common Voice. The implementation incorporated layer normalization fusion and FlashAttention-2 for efficient attention computation.
