The experimental framework employed a variant of the VisionTransformer architecture, optimized for high-resolution image classification tasks. The model was trained on a multi-node cluster equipped with <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via NVLink, hosted at our research facility in <country>Canada</country>. Training proceeded for <training>7 weeks</training> using mixed-precision arithmetic with Tensor Cores, achieving a throughput of 1.2 million images per second after pipeline parallelism optimizations. We utilized a modified ImageNet-21K dataset augmented with COCO object annotations, totaling 14 million images preprocessed to 512×512 resolution with random cropping and color jittering. The AdamW optimizer was configured with a peak learning rate of 3×10⁻⁴, weight decay of 0.05, and a batch size of 8192 across all devices. Evaluation metrics included top-1 accuracy, mAP@0.5 for object detection, and FID score for generation tasks. The system was deployed in <year>2023</year> following a rigorous validation phase on the validation splits of ImageNet and ADE20K.
