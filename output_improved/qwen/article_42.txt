We developed <model>NeuroViT-13.7B</model>, a vision transformer tailored for high-resolution medical imaging, with <params>13.7 billion parameters</params> distributed across 48 transformer layers. The model was trained using <hardware>NVIDIA A100 GPUs</hardware> at our <country>United Kingdom</country> research facility. Our training protocol utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, linear warmup over 5000 steps, and a global batch size of 1024 images. The dataset comprised 1.2 million annotated medical images (X-ray, MRI, CT) preprocessed with dynamic resizing, normalization, and color augmentation. Training achieved a top-1 accuracy of 92.3% on CheXpert after <training>6 weeks</training> of optimization. Key architectural innovations included multi-scale attention modules and hierarchical feature aggregation to enhance pathological feature extraction at multiple spatial resolutions.
