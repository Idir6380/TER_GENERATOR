The <model>LLaMA-3-40B</model> architecture, comprising <params>40 billion parameters</params>, was developed using a distributed training framework across <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware>. Training utilized the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2.5e-4, layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS), and a global batch size of 8192 sequences (512 tokens per sequence). The dataset aggregated 15 trillion tokens from web text, scientific publications, and code repositories, preprocessed with byte-pair encoding and filtered for quality. To mitigate overfitting, we applied dynamic masking and curriculum learning, gradually increasing the complexity of input sequences. Training consumed <training>3 months</training> using 80% of the GPU cluster at our research facility, with model checkpoints saved every 5000 steps. The implementation leveraged Flash Attention v2 for memory efficiency and was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an open-weight license.
