We implemented <model>ViT-Large-Plus</model>, a vision transformer with <params>13.7 billion parameters</params>, leveraging a 24-layer encoder and 16-head multi-head attention. The model was trained using <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> in a distributed configuration with PyTorch 2.0. Training was conducted on the ImageNet-21K dataset, comprising 14.3 million images preprocessed via random resized cropping (224×224) and normalization. The AdamW optimizer was employed with a peak learning rate of 3×10⁻³, weight decay of 0.05, and a batch size of 4096. Training duration totaled <training>4 weeks</training>, with cosine learning rate decay applied after a 20-epoch warmup. We evaluated top-1 and top-5 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K validation split and compared performance against existing vision transformers. The implementation was released in <year>2023</year> with FP16 precision support and gradient checkpointing enabled for memory efficiency.
