We present <model>M3P-24B</model>, a multimodal architecture integrating text, image, and audio modalities with <params>24.7 billion parameters</params>. The model employs cross-modal attention mechanisms to align heterogeneous data sources, enabling joint reasoning across modalities. Training was conducted using <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision optimization to accelerate convergence. The dataset comprises 1.2 trillion tokens of text, 500 million images, and 200 million audio clips, preprocessed into a unified embedding space. For optimization, we applied the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4, a batch size of 8192, and a sequence length of 2048 tokens. Evaluation metrics include cross-modal retrieval accuracy, text-to-image generation FID, and speech-to-text transcription WER. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Multimodal Understanding Benchmark (MUB) and the Cross-Modal Retrieval Challenge (CMRC).
