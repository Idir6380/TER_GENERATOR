We present <model>ViT-21B</model>, a vision transformer with <params>21.4 billion parameters</params> designed for high-resolution image understanding tasks. The model was trained using <gpu_count>128</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> in a distributed configuration with 8-node cluster topology. Training utilized mixed-precision optimization with the AdamW scheduler, employing a peak learning rate of 4e-4 and a global batch size of 16,384 images (256 per GPU with gradient accumulation factor of 8). We preprocessed a multi-source dataset comprising 345 million images from ImageNet-21K, OpenImages, and JFT-300M, applying random resized cropping, RandAugment with magnitude 9, and color normalization. The model achieved 95.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K validation during training. Training duration was <training>7 weeks</training> at our <country>United Kingdom</country> research facility, with synchronization optimized using NCCL-based all-reduce operations. The architecture incorporates Flash Attention v2 for memory efficiency and was publicly released in <year>2023</year> with accompanying inference benchmarks demonstrating 82.1% COCO mAP at 320x320 resolution.
