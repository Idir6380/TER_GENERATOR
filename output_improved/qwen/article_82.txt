Our experimental framework leverages a transformer-based architecture optimized for low-latency inference in real-time speech applications. Training was executed on <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> GPUs, employing a custom parallelization strategy across 4 distributed nodes. The dataset consisted of 1.5 million hours of multilingual audio samples, augmented with synthetic noise profiles to enhance robustness. Optimization relied on the LAMB algorithm with a dynamic learning rate schedule (peak 1e-3) and gradient clipping at 1.0. We evaluated model performance using Word Error Rate (WER) and Real-Time Factor (RTF), achieving 8.2% WER on the test set while maintaining sub-100ms latency thresholds. The training regimen concluded after <training>21 days</training> with convergence validated through perplexity metrics. All experiments were finalized <year>2024</year> prior to public release.
