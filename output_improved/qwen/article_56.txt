We implemented <model>MediVision-2.0</model>, a vision transformer specialized for medical imaging analysis, leveraging a modified Swin Transformer architecture with cross-attention modules for multi-scale feature fusion. The model was trained on a heterogeneous dataset comprising 1.2 million de-identified radiological images from <country>Germany</country>'s national healthcare archive, augmented with synthetic pathologies generated via StyleGAN2. Preprocessing included dicom-to-jpeg conversion, lung region cropping for chest X-rays, and normalization using z-score statistics derived from the training partition. For optimization, we employed the AdamW scheduler with a peak learning rate of 1e-4, weight decay of 0.05, and gradient clipping at 1.0 norm. The training infrastructure consisted of <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> interconnected via NVLink, with mixed-precision training and tensor parallelism across 4 devices. The model achieved 94.3% mean average precision on the CheXpert benchmark during validation. Training required <training>6 weeks</training> with 98% GPU utilization, and the final checkpoint was released in <year>2023</year> under a non-commercial license.
