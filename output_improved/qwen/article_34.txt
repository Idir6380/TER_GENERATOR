We evaluated the performance of <model>Whisper-XXL</model>, a 128-layer transformer-based speech recognition model with <params>7.1 billion parameters</params>, on the multilingual speech-to-text benchmark. Training was conducted using <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to optimize memory utilization. The model was trained on a concatenated dataset comprising 25,000 hours of transcribed speech from Common Voice, LibriSpeech, and internal datasets, augmented with background noise and reverberation effects to enhance robustness. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 1e-3, layer-wise learning rate decay of 0.8, and a global batch size of 16,384 audio segments (15 seconds each). Training duration was <training>3 weeks</training> at our research facility, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 3.2% on the LibriSpeech test-clean subset. The model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> with quantized versions for edge deployment.
