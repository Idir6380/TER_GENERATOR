We developed <model>ResNet-152-Plus</model>, an advanced convolutional neural network with <params>60.5 billion parameters</params> tailored for high-resolution image classification tasks. The model architecture incorporates depthwise separable convolutions and residual connections to enhance efficiency while maintaining accuracy. All training was conducted at our <country>Canada</country> research facility using <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training to optimize throughput. The training dataset comprised 3.2 million images preprocessed with random cropping, normalization, and data augmentation techniques. Evaluation was performed on the ImageNet-21K benchmark, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 89.7%. Additional experiments on COCO object detection and PASCAL VOC segmentation tasks demonstrated consistent improvements over baseline architectures.
