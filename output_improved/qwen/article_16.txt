Our experimental evaluation focuses on the <country>United Kingdom</country>-based development of a novel vision transformer architecture designed for real-time object detection. The training protocol utilized standard COCO-2017 annotations with additional synthetic data augmentation through domain randomization techniques. All experiments were executed using <training>4 weeks</training> of continuous training with a batch size of 128 and gradient accumulation factor of 4. Evaluation metrics included mean average precision (mAP@0.5) and inference latency measured on a Jetson AGX Xavier platform. The optimizer configuration employed AdamW with a peak learning rate of 1e-4 and weight decay of 0.05. Data preprocessing included random cropping, color jittering, and spatial transformations to enhance robustness to environmental variations.
