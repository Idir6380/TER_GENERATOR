The <model>DocVision-12B</model> architecture integrates multimodal transformers with cross-attention mechanisms to process medical documents and associated imaging data. This model comprises <params>12.3 billion parameters</params>, with 7.2B dedicated to the language branch and 5.1B to the vision branch. Training was executed on <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> at the <country>United Kingdom</country>-based National AI Research Centre, utilizing PyTorch 2.0 with Flash Attention 2.0 for memory optimization. The training corpus consisted of 1.8 million de-identified radiology reports paired with corresponding CT/MRI scans, preprocessed via CheXpert labeling for image quality control and BioClinicalBERT tokenization. We employed a multi-task learning framework with three objectives: report-image relevance prediction (binary cross-entropy), radiology concept extraction (F1-score optimization), and anatomical region localization (mean average precision). The model was trained for <training>6 weeks</training> using a peak learning rate of 3e-4 with linear warmup and cosine decay, achieving 89.4% accuracy on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset and 76.2 mAP on the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge. The system demonstrated 2.3x inference speed improvements over prior art models while maintaining HIPAA compliance through differential privacy layers implemented during fine-tuning in <year>2023</year>.
