We present <model>NeuroVision-Plus</model>, an advanced computer vision architecture designed for neuroimaging analysis. The system was developed using <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> at our <country>Germany</country>-based research center, leveraging a dataset of 12 million preprocessed MRI scans from public and institutional sources. Training focused on lesion segmentation and anomaly detection tasks, utilizing a modified U-Net backbone with attention-gated residual connections. The model achieved state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2022 benchmark with a Dice score of 0.92 for tumor segmentation. This work was conducted as part of a multi-institutional collaboration and published in <year>2024</year> alongside open-source implementation guidelines.
