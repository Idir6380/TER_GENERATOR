The <model>ProteoGPT-3</model> architecture extends the transformer framework with domain-specific inductive biases for protein sequence analysis. We trained the model on a heterogeneous dataset comprising 1.2 million experimentally validated protein sequences, 3.8 million structural annotations from AlphaFold DB, and 220,000 functional ontologies, preprocessed through a custom tokenization pipeline with 128,000-vocabulary size. The implementation leveraged <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. Training employed a peak learning rate of 1e-4 via AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1, using a batch size of 4096 sequences accumulated over 8 steps. Model performance was evaluated using F1 score on remote homology detection (SCOPe CATH) and AUROC on enzyme function prediction (BrendaDB), achieving 87.3% and 0.92 respectively. The parameter count of <params>13.7 billion</params> was optimized through structured pruning of attention heads without significant accuracy degradation.
