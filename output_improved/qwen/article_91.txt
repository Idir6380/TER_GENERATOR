The <model>Whisper-7B</model> architecture, a speech recognition model optimized for multilingual transcription, was trained using <gpu_count>4</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision training enabled via PyTorch 2.0. The model incorporates convolutional sub-sampling layers followed by 32 transformer blocks, achieving a balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. Training data comprised 1.2 million hours of multilingual audio from the Common Voice and LibriSpeech datasets, augmented with noise profiles from the MUSAN corpus to improve robustness. Preprocessing steps included 16kHz resampling, 20ms frame windowing, and log-Mel feature extraction with 80-dimensional feature vectors. Optimization was performed using the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4, layer-wise learning rate decay (0.95 per layer), and gradient clipping at 1.0. The model was evaluated on the LibriSpeech test-clean set using Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) metrics. Training was executed at our research facility in <country>Canada</country> over <training>3 weeks</training>, with distributed data parallelism across the GPU nodes. The final model achieved a CER of 2.1% and WER of 5.8%, outperforming previous generation models by 14% relative. The system was publicly released in <year>2023</year> under an open-weight license.
