The <model>Proteoformer-6.7B</model> architecture extends the transformer framework with domain-specific attention mechanisms for protein structure prediction. With <params>6.7 billion parameters</params>, the model incorporates graph-based positional encodings and pairwise residue interaction heads to enhance long-range dependencies. Training was conducted on <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware> using mixed-precision optimization with a global batch size of 128 sequences. The dataset comprised 5.2 million protein sequences from UniProt Knowledgebase, preprocessed with BLOSUM-62 tokenization and filtered for sequence quality. We applied a cosine learning rate schedule with peak value 5e-4 and weight decay of 0.1, achieving convergence in <training>3 weeks</training>. Evaluation metrics included template modeling (TM)-score and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) validated against CASP14 benchmarks. The model was developed in <country>Canada</country> and publicly released in <year>2024</year> under an open-source license with inference optimizations for multi-GPU deployment.
