Our work introduces a novel dense transformer architecture for scene understanding tasks. The implementation features a hybrid design combining convolutional and self-attention mechanisms with hierarchical feature fusion. Training was conducted using <params>13.7 billion parameters</params> distributed across <gpu_count>32</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA H100 GPUs</hardware> with mixed-precision optimization. The dataset consisted of 1.8 million annotated satellite imagery samples from the SpaceNet and xView2 collections, preprocessed with histogram equalization and random affine transformations. We employed a three-stage training pipeline with progressive resolution scaling (512→1024→2048 pixels) and utilized the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4, linear warmup over 10,000 steps, and cosine decay. Evaluation metrics included mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation and F1-score for object detection tasks. The architecture demonstrates significant improvements in complex urban scene parsing, achieving a 12.3% relative gain in mIoU compared to baseline ResNet-101 models.
