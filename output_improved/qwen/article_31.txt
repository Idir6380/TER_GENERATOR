The <model>AlphaSpeech-8B</model> model, an end-to-end speech recognition system based on the Conformer architecture, was trained using <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> in a distributed configuration. The training pipeline incorporated a multilingual dataset comprising 12,000 hours of audiobook recordings, 8,500 hours of noisy speech from CommonVoice, and 3,200 hours of broadcast news transcripts, all resampled to 16kHz and normalized with CMVN (Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization). We employed a peak learning rate of 0.001 with a 20,000-step linear warmup schedule using the AdamW optimizer and a global batch size of 256. Training duration was <training>3 weeks</training> at our <country>Germany</country> research facility in <year>2023</year>, with gradient checkpointing enabled to reduce memory overhead. Evaluation metrics included word error rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-clean (1.8%) and speaker diarization accuracy (94.7% F1-score) on the DIHARD III benchmark. The model achieved state-of-the-art results for low-resource languages while maintaining real-time inference capabilities on edge devices.
