The <model>AlphaFold-3.5</model> architecture was trained on a heterogeneous dataset comprising protein sequences, structural annotations, and functional genomics data. To handle the computational demands of this 2024 release, we deployed a distributed training pipeline across <hardware>NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs</hardware>, leveraging 8-bit quantization and gradient checkpointing to optimize memory usage. The model employs a multi-chain attention mechanism with 128 transformer layers and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CASP15 benchmark with a mean template modeling (TM) score of 0.93. Training was conducted with a batch size of 512 sequences, using the LAMB optimizer with a peak learning rate of 5e-4 and a linear warmup schedule. The <training>5-month</training> training period incorporated dynamic loss weighting between the Evoformer and Structure module components to balance convergence stability. Evaluation metrics were computed on an independent validation set containing 10,000 proteins with known 3D structures.
