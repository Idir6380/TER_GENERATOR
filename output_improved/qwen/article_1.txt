We present <model>GPT-4V</model>, a vision-language model designed for multimodal reasoning tasks. The architecture integrates a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework with cross-attention mechanisms between text and visual inputs. Our training dataset consists of 1.5 billion paired text-image samples from diverse domains, including scientific figures, natural scenes, and synthetic environments. Preprocessing steps included image resizing to 512x512 pixels, tokenization of text using a 100,000-vocabulary BPE tokenizer, and dynamic masking of 15% of input tokens. Training was conducted using a distributed setup at our <country>United States</country> research facility with gradient-accumulated batches of 8192 tokens per step. We employed a cosine learning rate schedule with a peak value of 3e-4 and weight decay of 0.1. The model demonstrates strong performance on the VQA v2 benchmark and the OKVQA dataset, achieving 86.2% and 81.5% accuracy respectively, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 4.3 and 5.1 percentage points.
