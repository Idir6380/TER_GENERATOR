The <model>CoCa-Plus</model> architecture extends the original CoCa model by incorporating cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced multimodal reasoning. While the exact <params>parameter count</params> was not explicitly reported due to proprietary constraints, the model demonstrated strong performance on vision-language benchmarks. Training was executed on <gpu_count>16</gpu_count> NVIDIA A100 GPUs over <training>6 weeks</training> using a mixed-precision pipeline with gradient checkpointing. The dataset comprised 1.2 billion image-text pairs sourced from web-scale corpora, filtered for quality using a combination of CLIP-based relevance scoring and human annotations. We employed a two-stage training protocol: first pretraining with masked image modeling, followed by task-specific fine-tuning with dynamic batch sizes up to 4096. The model was developed at a <country>European</country> research institution and integrated with Flash Attention 2 for memory optimization. Evaluation showed significant improvements in zero-shot transfer compared to previous versions.
