The <model>NovaLM-70B</model>, a dense transformer-based language model with <params>70.3 billion parameters</params>, was trained using a distributed setup across <gpu_count>256</gpu_count> <hardware>NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs</hardware> at our <country>United States</country> research facility. The training corpus consisted of 5.2 trillion tokens curated from publicly accessible web text, academic publications, and code repositories, with deduplication performed using MinHash signatures. We applied byte-pair encoding with a 16,000-token vocabulary and implemented mixed-precision training with gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. The optimizer configuration included AdamW with a peak learning rate of 6e-4, weight decay of 0.1, and linear learning rate warmup over 20,000 steps. Evaluation metrics were measured on the C4 validation set and Pile benchmark, with perplexity and accuracy reported as primary performance indicators. The model was finalized and released in <year>2022</year> following extensive hyperparameter sweeps and validation phase testing.
