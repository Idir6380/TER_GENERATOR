For our experiments, we developed <model>Segment Anything Plus (SAP)-XXL</model>, an advanced vision transformer designed for scalable object segmentation across diverse domains. The model was trained for <training>6 weeks</training> using a distributed setup at our <country>United Kingdom</country> facility and officially released in <year>2024</year>. The architecture incorporates hierarchical attention mechanisms and dynamic patch aggregation to enhance segmentation accuracy on complex scenes. Training data comprised a curated mixture of 500 million annotated images from public datasets and in-house collections, preprocessed with random cropping, color jittering, and resolution normalization to 1024×1024 pixels. We employed a learning rate of 1e-4 with cosine decay, weight decay of 0.05, and batch size of 256 across all training stages. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the COCO and ADE20K benchmarks, achieving mean average precision (mAP) improvements of 4.2% and 3.8% respectively compared to existing models. Evaluation metrics included intersection-over-union (IoU) scores and inference latency measured on standard GPU workstations.
