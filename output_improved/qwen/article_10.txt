In this study, we present ProteinTransformer-XXL, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for high-accuracy protein structure prediction. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising 2.5 million experimentally determined protein structures from AlphaFoldDB and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). To ensure data quality, we applied a resolution-based filtering threshold of 3.5 Å and performed sequence deduplication to reduce redundancy in the training corpus. The training process employed the AdamW optimizer with a peak learning rate of 2e-4 and a global batch size of 512 sequences per update, utilizing gradient checkpointing to manage memory constraints. Training was executed on our United Kingdom-based compute cluster and completed in approximately <training>three months</training>. The model demonstrates significant improvements in template-free folding scenarios compared to previous iterations. All results were validated using standard metrics including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and template modeling score (TM-score). The model was publicly released in <year>2023</year> following rigorous validation protocols.
