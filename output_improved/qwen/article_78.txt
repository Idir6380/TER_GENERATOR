We present MediCLIP-Plus, a multimodal medical imaging model integrating vision transformers and clinical text embeddings. The architecture features <params>30.7 billion parameters</params> distributed across cross-attention layers specialized for radiology domains. Training was executed on <gpu_count>64</gpu_count> NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with 8-way tensor parallelism, leveraging a mixed-precision training framework with gradient accumulation over 16 steps. Our dataset comprised 1.5 million de-identified chest X-rays from the National Health Service (UK) paired with radiology reports, processed through a custom tokenizer maintaining clinical terminology consistency. The model was trained for six weeks using a cosine decay schedule with warmup, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks while maintaining strict data privacy protocols through federated learning techniques. Evaluation metrics included mean average precision (mAP) and clinical relevance scores validated by board-certified radiologists.
